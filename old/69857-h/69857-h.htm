</div>


<p>All witnesses agree that Robert Burns was a vivid
and dynamic personality. All readers of his poetry
concur. Yet somehow the personality which blazes
in the poems and glows in the letters only smoulders
in the biographies. Why is it so hard to write a
dull life of, say, Byron, and so easy to write a dull
one of Burns? For one thing, there are too many biographies,
all following the same stereotyped outline
of dividing the poet’s life according to the places he
lived in instead of according to the things he did and
thought. Then really graphic memorabilia are
scarce, especially for the formative years in Ayrshire.
People keep saying that Burns was a brilliant
talker, but they seldom report his talk. Finally, too
many biographers have worked in the wrong mood,
intent on moralizing or deprecating rather than interpreting.</p>

<p>This book is not a biography, if that word connotes
a narrative written in straight time-sequence.
It is, instead, my answer to the question, subordinated
or ignored by most chronological biographers,
What sort of a man was Robert Burns? I have therefore
discarded time-sequence in favour of the relationships
of everyday life in which Burns most
clearly revealed his personality. The plan has at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
least the advantage of passing quickly over his
almost undocumented youth, and concentrating
attention upon his fully recorded manhood. The
formal biography, whether it be Mrs. Carswell’s
romantic approach or Professor Snyder’s scholarly
one, suffers from the necessity of devoting more
space to the scantily reported twenty-seven years in
Ayrshire than to the five richly documented years in
Dumfries. I have assumed that Burns’s character
can best be determined from the completest records.
Perhaps to himself John Syme and Maria Riddell
were not so important as Robert Muir and Margaret
Chalmers, but the later friendships can be
studied at full length; the earlier ones cannot.
Hence I have given most space to the relationships
in which guess-work can be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>So, too, I have deliberately limited myself to the
best authenticated sources—Burns’s own letters and
poems, and the letters and other records of his immediate
contemporaries. Unsupported oral tradition
I have avoided as basic material. Though I use
such anecdotes now and again as secondary illustrations,
it is always with a warning as to their
nature. I have likewise tried to make clear the distinction
between facts and the inferences I have
drawn from them.</p>

<p>In one respect at least my preparation for writing
about Burns is unique. Most editors and biographers
have either been bred in the rosy mists of
the Burns legend or have worked their way back to the
original records through a mass of secondary printed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
matter. Up to a dozen years ago my knowledge of
Burns and his times included little beyond such
reading of major works and standard criticism as
one does in preparation for the doctorate. In 1925 I
undertook to edit a reprint of Burns’s chief poems.
Discovering in the course of that job how unsatisfactory
were all editions of his correspondence, I
thereupon plunged into the work of tracing and collating
the original holographs. Not until after thorough
immersion in these primary sources did I extend
my studies to the letters and other records of
Burns’s contemporaries and to the Burns tradition
embalmed in the biographies and standard editions.
When I started I had therefore everything to learn,
but nothing to unlearn, and my basic impression of
the poet and his work was founded on intimate acquaintance
with his own words, and not on what
other people had said about him.</p>

<p>The large number of new documents which have
turned up in recent years replaces conjecture with
certainty in many once disputed episodes in Burns’s
career. We need no longer depend on libellous
Saunders Tait for details of William Burnes’s troubles
at Lochlie; the chronology of the poet’s Edinburgh
peccadillos is fairly clear; we know why
Mrs. Dunlop broke off her correspondence. The verification
and completion of the texts of more than
three-fourths of Burns’s own letters is only a part of
the fresh material. Collateral documents ranging
from Elizabeth Paton’s discharge of her claim
against Burns to the almost complete correspondence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
of two of his most intimate friends are now
available, and I have used them freely. I have also
drawn upon other sources not fully utilized in the
past. Most biographers, for instance, have contemned
the so-called ‘Train MS.’ in Edinburgh
University library. This collection of notes on Lockhart’s
<i>Life of Burns</i> consists mainly of anecdotes deriving
ultimately from the poet’s friend, John Richmond.
It has been repudiated <i>in toto</i> for no better
reason, seemingly, than that Richmond told a story
about one Mary Campbell which does not tally
with the romantic account of Highland Mary, and
was mistaken in the identity of a lady who once
called at Burns’s lodgings in Baxter’s Close. Against
these two doubtful items I set the fact that the author
of the notes so accurately described unpublished
letters and verses which he had seen that
every one of them since published can be instantly
identified. I base no major conclusions on this MS.,
but I can see no justification for ignoring it.</p>

<p>I need not enumerate the volumes of biography,
history, and memoirs which have contributed background
materials. They are listed in all the standard
bibliographies. The one great addition to the
older lists is the <i>Journals</i> of James Boswell, which
have furnished graphic details of Scottish life. I hasten
to add, however, that Chapter I is not intended
as a complete survey of eighteenth-century Scotland.
Even had completeness been possible in the
space at my disposal, it would have been useless to
attempt to repeat what Professor H. W. Thompson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
has so superbly done in <i>A Scottish Man of Feeling</i>.
Hence I have limited myself to those aspects of national
life which bore directly upon Burns, as I have
also done in considering the influence of contemporary
literature. The eighteenth century was not
all ‘elegance’, but it was the elegant authors, and not
Swift, Fielding, and Johnson, who appealed to
Burns.</p>

<p>Lest British readers charitably assume that I sin
through ignorance, I ought perhaps also to add that
in writing of Burns’s world I have not hesitated to
equate some of its social and political aspects with
their twentieth-century American analogues. To
describe a dead world in dead terms seems a poor
way of revivifying it. My omission of footnotes is
likewise deliberate. In a score of articles in various
journals during the past decade I have presented,
and fully documented, the evidence on many controversial
points. The articles evoked an almost passionate
apathy; nevertheless they, and their footnotes,
are there if anyone cares to look them up.
Furthermore, nearly all the source documents I
have used are now in print, despite the efforts of
Burns’s self-appointed literary executors to suppress
certain of them. On two points I recant some
of my earlier statements: I know now that the circumstances
of Burns’s quarrel with the Riddells are
not so clear as I once thought them, and Mr. Stanley
Cursiter of the Scottish National Gallery has
given me reason to doubt my identification of the miniature
portrait belonging to Mr. Oliver R. Barrett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span></p>

<p>Transcripts of most of the unpublished documents
I have used are included in Mr. Robert T. Fitzhugh’s
Cornell University dissertation, ‘Robert
Burns as Seen by his Contemporaries’ (1935). I am
deeply indebted to Mr. Fitzhugh for the use of this
material and of other documents he has discovered
more recently, chief among them the letter in which
Robert Ainslie described to Agnes M’Lehose his
visit to Ellisland in October, 1790. In addition to
the Train MS., above mentioned, Mr. Fitzhugh’s
thesis includes numerous letters by Burns’s contemporaries,
of which the most important are the
forty-one which passed between John Syme and
Alexander Cunningham from 1789 to 1797. On
publication in the <i>Burns Chronicle</i> these letters were
considerably expurgated, the deletions including details
of the Caledonian Hunt’s revelry in Dumfries
and the most graphic description which has yet
come to light in connection with Burns of a wet
evening over the punchbowl.</p>

<p>Many other people have helped me in the work.
My wife typed most of it in its original form, clarified
doubtful points by debating them, and did her
best to restrain the wilder excesses of Ph.D. diction.
My colleague, Winfield H. Rogers, read the manuscript,
and made many useful comments. A famous
British firm gave me free permission to use one of
Burns’s bawdier letters, but after I published it they
were taken to task by one of the literary executors
above mentioned. Since they found it easier to repudiate
a foreigner than to face the wrath of a compatriot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
I shall not embarrass them by repeating my
thanks here. I am indebted to Col. Sir John Murray,
D.S.O., for use of the original MS. of Burns’s
journal of his Border tour. Mr. Davidson Cook,
Mr. George W. Shirley, and Mr. John M’Vie have
all shared their Burns discoveries with me, and
Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach, Mr. Gabriel Wells, and the
late Mr. Charles Sessler renewed my obligations to
them by allowing me to collate MSS. which came
into their hands after my edition of the <i>Letters</i> was
published. And finally, I owe a still deeper renewal
of gratitude to the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation, to whose grant-in-aid this present
volume owes its appearance.</p>

<p class="ph2">SCOTLAND</p>


<p>A Scot in the eighteenth century was a poor relation,
subject to the slights and scorns of more prosperous
kinfolk, and reared amid poverty, theology,
and filth. When Robert Burns was born, on January
25, 1759, his native land was almost at the nadir
of its independent existence. Proud and warlike and
desperately poor, Scotland had been still an essentially
feudal nation when King James VI was called
from amid the bickerings of his jealous nobles and
intransigent clergy to become James I of England.
The permanent removal of the court to London left
the country more than ever the prey of contention
among its nobles and fanaticism among its ecclesiastics;
governed by a parliament without authority;
torn at intervals by rebellion and civil strife; denied
commercial parity with England, and cut off from
the old-time free intercourse with France.</p>

<p>The Act of Union of 1707, by admitting Scotland
to commercial privileges formerly restricted to
England, started the country on the road to material
prosperity, but promised to destroy the last vestiges
of national pride. It was ‘the end of an old
song’. Thenceforward the affairs of Scotland were
entrusted to a handful of representatives at Westminster,
too small, in those days of patronage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
pocket-boroughs, to have enabled even a Scottish
Parnell, had there been one, to sway the balance of
power. Scotland was no longer Scotland; it was
North Britain. And when the House of Hanover
succeeded to the English throne, the last vestige of
Scottish influence in the government seemed to
have vanished. Ruled no longer by the Stuarts—her
own kings, even though absentee—but by ‘an insolent,
beef-witted race of foreigners’, Scotland turned
more and more to the things of the flesh. The last
flicker of the ancient loyalties in the ’45 shed only
light enough to reveal their death. The Lowlands,
though they could not stomach the double treason
of a man like Murray of Broughton, acquiesced in
the brutal destruction of the Highland clans. Most
of the comfortable merchants and landed gentry
had viewed the uprising with an apprehension even
livelier than that felt by the German court four
hundred miles away; when the Highlands were
crushed they rejoiced in their own increased security,
and showed their loyalty to the reigning House
by christening their daughters Charlotte and Wilhelmina,
and their new streets and squares Hanover
and Brunswick and George.</p>

<p>By the middle of the century Scottish affairs had
settled into an order which might alter in degree,
but would not alter in kind, for two generations at
least. Politically, the country was little more than a
conquered province. Economically it was beginning
to emerge from age-old poverty, but the new prosperity
of the lucky few was widening the gap between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
them and the poor and still further depressing
the latter. Religiously it was awakening from the
nightmare of Calvinism which had paralysed free
thought and free action for two centuries. Intellectually
its literary life was being overwhelmed by the
fashions and standards of England, and its educated
citizens were suffering from an inferiority complex
of national scope.</p>

<p>When Warren Hastings was impeached, Burns
was angry because it was done in the name of the
Commons of England and not of Great Britain. Had
he expressed his opinion in public, instead of in a
private letter, it would have roused little sympathy
among his more influential countrymen. Most
would have dismissed it as the rant of a fanatic; a
few would have held it downright treason. There
was no money in being a Scottish patriot. As in
England, all things political went by favour. The
only difference was that in Scotland they went by
favour of one man—the Duke of Argyll, the Earl of
Bute, or Henry Dundas, as the case might be. All
power concentrated at last in the hands of the national
boss. He ‘suggested’ the choice of the sixteen
Scottish peers who were to represent their country
in the House of Lords; he controlled the election of
the forty-five members of the Commons; his word
was law as to all appointive offices. Fifteen members
of the Commons were chosen by the burgh councils—self-perpetuating
groups which in ‘the taciturn
regularity of ancient affairs’ allowed no outsider to
intrude on their privileges and their graft. The other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
thirty were chosen by the counties, and in all Scotland
there were fewer than three thousand qualified
electors, every man of whom was ticketed as to party
allegiance and family connection. Most of them also
had their prices plainly marked on their tickets. Of
course the price need be nothing so crude as cash.
Every job, from a cadetship with the East India
Company to the governorship of a province, was obtainable
by influence, and by influence only; hence
there were plenty of ways of swaying a man’s vote,
especially if he had a rising family of hungry younger
sons, without soiling his fingers with gold.</p>

<p>Everyone played the game, and took the rules for
granted. Why wait for merited promotion, if you
could get it quicker by pulling wires? The only man
Sir Walter Scott ever deliberately cut was the one
who publicly criticized him for securing his brother’s
appointment to a post which he knew was soon to be
abolished—with a pension for the ousted incumbent.
It was a comfortable system for those on the
inside. As for the others, they were expected to do
their duty in that state of life to which it had pleased
God to call them.</p>

<p>But it was not merely in political jobs that the influential
classes were doing well for themselves. The
Act of Union had admitted Scottish merchants to
the privileges of the colonial trade formerly open
only to the English. Throughout the eighteenth century
the south of Scotland experienced a whole series
of industrial and real estate booms. Though by
twentieth-century standards of bankruptcy the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
booms were small and local, they had all the familiar
characteristics. Glasgow and its neighbourhood,
for instance, when once it had recovered from the
losses of the crazy Darien Expedition—as wild a
speculation as the later Mississippi Bubble in France
and the South Sea madness in England—throve
soberly on its steadily increasing commerce with the
West Indies and the American Colonies. The passerby
today, between the Trongate and the Broomielaw,
may read in Union Street and George Square
how mercantile Scotland felt towards the loss of its
parliament, and find Jamaica and Virginia Streets
underscoring the reason; further west, St. Vincent
Street, Nile Street, Pitt Street, and Wellington
Street show the direction of Glaswegian sympathies
in the long struggle with Napoleon. And since commerce
is by definition two-sided the ships which
brought back American cotton and tobacco and
sugar took out Scottish linens and woolens and
shoes from steadily growing centres of manufacture.</p>

<p>On the east coast, Edinburgh was not merely expanding;
it was on the way to transforming itself.
Unable by its location to share directly in the overseas
trade, it throve on the legal business which grew
out of that trade, on the increasing demand for
education which benefited both the university and
the printers and booksellers, and on the invested
profits of Scotsmen who had made money in the
East or West Indies and who settled in the capital
when they retired. Until after the ’45 the city was
still packed along the ridge from Holyrood to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Castle, its population crowded into the tall tenements
which shut out the low northern sun from the
narrow wynds. Its first expansion was to the south, in
a development, near the present site of the University,
on which Burns’s father and uncle found work
when they struck out for themselves in 1750. To the
north of the Old Town all was then open country.
At the foot of the Castle Rock, where the railway
tracks now run, the marshy Nor Loch still received
whatever of the city’s garbage did not remain in the
streets. Burns was four years old when the real
growth of the modern city began with the building
of the North Bridge to connect the Old Town with
the ridge which paralleled it to northward. Each
year thereafter saw new houses or new squares
added, but as late as 1800 the New Town still consisted
only of Princes, George, and Queen Streets
from St. Andrew Square to Charlotte Square.</p>

<p>Until after Burns’s death the whole area, despite
the Georgian dignity and charm of its houses, retained
many of the features of a new and raw development.
In particular, the valley was half choked by
the hideous Mound formed of the earth excavated
in grading the New Town. The laying out of the
Princes Street Gardens and the crowning of the
Mound with the Scottish National Gallery were
still far in the future—there was even talk of a row
of buildings on the south side of Princes Street which
would have blinded one of the finest city vistas in
the world, and have made the Gardens forever impossible.
By 1786, when Burns first saw Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
wealth and fashion had already deserted the Old
Town, and middle-class respectability was beginning
to follow, but the business life of the city still
centred in the shops and taverns which lined the
High Street, crammed the narrow Luckenbooths
which congested traffic beside disfigured St. Giles’s,
and overflowed into all the adjacent courts and
closes. Professional men transacted their business
in taverns in preference to their crowded living-quarters;
all Edinburgh was accustomed to gather at
midday in the neighbourhood of the Cross to arrange
business and social appointments.</p>

<p>Sanitation did not exist. Water for cooking and
such exiguous washing as was done was carried by
porters from the public wells to the various flats in
the tall ‘lands’; the day’s filth of the household was
collected in a tub on the landing of the stairs and at
bedtime the barefoot maid-servants emptied it out
of the windows—theoretically to be gathered up by
the scavengers; actually, too often, to lie where it
fell until a rain washed it away. Even the hardy nostrils
of Londoners quailed before the marshalled
stenches of Edinburgh, and travelling Scotsmen
gauged the smells of foreign cities like Lisbon by
their nasal memories of home. That children should
die like flies was inevitable; the marvel is that any
survived. Deficiency diseases were as rife as filth
diseases. Rickets was taken for granted—a simile,
humorous in intent but ghastly in effect in one of
Scott’s letters, gives a glimpse of nurse-maids in
Princes Street trying to compel unhappy rachitic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
children to walk. Human life has always been Scotland’s
cheapest commodity. That a high degree of
social and intellectual culture should flourish amid
this filth is merely another proof of human capacity
for ignoring what it is too indolent to correct.</p>

<p>Outside the cities, as well as in them, Scottish life
was beginning to change. Primitive agriculture in
the northern kingdom, like the sanitation of Edinburgh,
seemed almost to be an effort to demonstrate
just how badly a thing could be done. The poorest
sorts of oats and barley, the scrubbiest of cattle, were
raised by the worst methods. The unfenced fields
were divided by a system of ridges and ditches which
managed to combine the maximum of soil wastage
with the minimum of drainage. The ‘infield’, as this
dyked portion of the farm was called, was cultivated
with ploughs so crude and awkward that they required
four horses and two men to handle them. The
‘outfield’, or pasture, was never cultivated or manured;
overrun with moss and weeds it yielded even
in summer only a scanty and unwholesome pasturage,
with little if any surplus to carry the cattle
through the winter. All excess stock was slaughtered
in the fall, and for six months of the year the people
who could afford meat at all had to subsist like seamen
on salt beef and smoked mutton hams. The
wretched beasts which were kept through the winter
were fed mainly on straw, and frequently by
spring were so weak and emaciated that they had
to be carried to the pasture.</p>

<p>The owners of the cattle lived in a style which an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Iroquois would have thought primitive. Gilbert
Burns resented the statement that his famous
brother was born in a hovel. The Alloway cottage,
he declared, was better than the houses then occupied
by many substantial farmers. So it was. It had
a chimney, whereas in many a cottage and farmhouse,
long after Burns’s youth—Keats saw plenty
of them in Ayrshire in 1818—such of the smoke as
did not enter the eyes and lungs of the tenants escaped
through the door. But even with a chimney
the average farmhouse or labourer’s cottage, with its
walls of stone or rammed clay, its earthen floor and
thatched roof, and with the fire seldom built up except
for cooking, had a winter chill and dampness
that bred tuberculosis in the young and rheumatism
in the old. As at Alloway, the stable was usually
under the same roof, and its reek mingled with
the dampness and the smell of unwashed humanity.
An English proverb in the seventeenth century asserted
that the Scots had neither bellows, warming-pans,
nor houses of office; and that the proverb
still held in the eighteenth is proved alike by experiences
of Johnson and Boswell in gentlemen’s
homes in the Highlands and by episodes in the
chapbooks of Dugal Graham which reveal the same
use of the fireplace as Shakespeare records of the inn
at Rochester. Outside the door was the midden-dub
or glaur-hole, manure-heap of man and beast alike,
often so surrounded with stagnant water that the
‘rather pretty’ girl whom Keats saw standing at a
cow-house door in the Highlands, ‘fac’d all up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the ankles in dirt’, would in the Lowlands a generation
earlier have been a sight too commonplace to
excite remark. When the seepage from the midden-dub
reached the water-supply the cycle of filth and
typhoid was complete. Dead animals which could
not be eaten were usually dumped into the nearest
stream, so that if the water-supply was not contaminated
in one way, it was pretty sure to be in another.
But unless the animal were a horse, it had to
be very dead indeed not to be eaten. Sheep that had
died by accident or disease had a special name—‘braxies’—and
were the perquisite of the shepherds;
the flesh of diseased cattle was sometimes the
only meat farm servants tasted; in Edinburgh young
Henry Mackenzie once observed two bakers of
cheap ‘mutton pies’ suspiciously engaged by night
about the carcass of a horse on the bank at the back
of the Castle.</p>

<p>Within doors all domestic equipment was on the
same primitive scale as the housing. At meal-times
the pot containing the thick oatmeal porridge which
was the staple food was placed in the centre of the
table, and each member of the family—servants included—fell
to work with his own spoon. Barley for
broth was prepared on the knocking-stone, counterpart
of the Mexican <i>metate</i>. Pewter dishes were a
luxury, and crockery ones almost unknown. Wooden
trenchers were frequently used even by the clergy,
and were the regular thing in farmhouses; the milk
was kept in wooden vessels so permeated with dirt
and bacteria that it soured in a few hours. The entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
family lived and ate and slept in two rooms, with
sometimes a windowless loft above as additional
sleeping-quarters for the servants or some of the
older children. Every cottage had at least one box-bed
built into the wall. When the occupants retired
and closed the sliding wooden doors they enjoyed a
practically airless seclusion amid their own effluvia.
The rest of the family slept on rough cots, or even
straw pallets on the floor. The popular saying, ‘The
clartier [dirtier] the cosier’, was not satire; it was
just a matter-of-fact summary of rural living conditions.</p>

<p>In dwellings like these, where a large family was
often augmented by several servants, privacy was as
impossible as in an army barrack. Any conversation
too intimate to be shouted above the uproar of the
children into the ears of a mixed audience had to be
conducted elsewhere than in the house—in the
fields, if the weather permitted; in the stable otherwise.
Even so, of course, all the circumstances leading
up to the conversation were known to a large
and intensely interested group. Hence the young
people, making a virtue of publicity, took their
cronies into their confidence and employed them to
arrange their trysts. Thus if James Smith beckoned
Jean Armour or Betsy Miller away from her giggling
family it was fairly certain that he was making an
appointment for Rob Mossgiel and not for himself;
if Burns waited on Jenny Surgeoner it was in John
Richmond’s interests and not in his own. It was difficult
to surprise, and impossible to shock by any of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the normal processes of nature, a people who lived
in such conditions. No one had to explain ‘the facts
of life’ to the children of that world; they witnessed
them daily. It would almost seem that a belief in
original virtue, rather than original sin, was requisite
to explain why the moral status of the peasantry
was often so much less squalid than their physical
surroundings.</p>

<p>As the century advanced, however, closer intercourse
with England roused ambitious landlords to
attempt improvements. Trees were planted on the
hillsides and about the naked houses; the ‘infields’
were levelled and enclosed. Yet nine-tenths of the
fences in Ayrshire were not built until after 1766,
and as late as 1800 two-thirds of Fife was still fenceless.
Rotation of crops, better cultivation, artificial
grasses, more productive types of grain, were all experimented
with. Potatoes and turnips, regarded as
garden luxuries in the early part of the century, began
to be grown on a large scale for human food and
stock feed respectively. John Wesley in 1780 noted
that vegetables had become as plentiful in Scotland
as in England, though on his first visit, in 1762, he
had found none at all, even on noblemen’s tables.
Carts were introduced for farm work, to take the
place of the ‘creels’ or panniers, in which manure
had formerly been borne on horseback to the fields,
and of the rough sledges on which the sheaves had
been hauled from harvest field to stackyard. The
wide use of carts, however, had in many districts to
await the improvement of the roads; in some instances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
when landlords first offered wheeled vehicles
as gifts to their tenants, they were refused because
it seemed impossible to drag them through
the mud.</p>

<p>Some few of the improving landlords were actuated
by disinterested zeal to better living-conditions;
their stubborn and superstitious peasants
were helped against their will. Many more landlords
were motivated by simple greed to improve their
rent-rolls. By breaking up small holdings occupied
on short-term leases, and throwing several together,
they made more profitable farms which were rented
for long terms. The consequent evictions, however,
produced an over-supply of would-be tenants
whose desperate need for land resulted in competitive
bidding from those willing to take a gambling
chance on getting from the soil more than it really
had to give. If they succeeded, it was too often at
the expense of the health and strength of themselves,
their children, and their servants.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so far as the improvements in
methods increased the productivity of the farms, the
new developments were economically sound. But
the nation’s increasing foreign trade operated to inflate
land values. Merchants who had made money
in the Indies wished to retire, and the prestige of
setting up as landed gentry combined with the lack
of sound corporate investments to bid up the value
of land in the more attractive parts of the kingdom
to levels where a fair return on the investment was
possible only by rack-renting the tenants. Burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
himself, and his father before him, were victims of
this over-capitalization. They had to pay for marginal
lands at rates which would have been fair
rentals for the best. And of course speculation in
land brought with it speculative banking. In Burns’s
youth many of the Ayrshire gentry were crippled or
ruined outright by the failure of the Douglas and
Heron Bank, which, organized on a lavish scale,
quickly got into trouble through excessive loans on
real estate. The ruined gentry retired to the Continent,
or to lodgings in Edinburgh, and their estates
were taken over by nabobs home from the Indies.</p>

<p>All this drama of political corruption and of social
and economic change was played against the background
of the old religious life of Scotland. Though
the intellectual life of the country had never been
squalid like its physical life, it had at the beginning
of the eighteenth century become torpid. From the
time of John Knox until after the Act of Union the
real government of Scotland, like that of colonial
Massachusetts, was a theocracy. The King and the
powers of the state were far off from the life of the
average peasant or tradesman, but the Kirk watched
all his goings out and comings in. Not only did it
administer matters which in other times and other
nations have been regarded as spiritual concerns,
but it also largely took the place of magistrates and
police. Critics of puritanism who have chosen colonial
New England as their dire example have made a
mistake. They should have chosen Scotland. Whatever
the theory of church government in New England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
may have been, in practice the man at odds
with the establishment suffered few real hardships
beyond the loss of his vote and a moderate amount
of discriminatory taxation—provided he had the
discretion to mind his business and keep his mouth
shut. But in seventeenth-century Scotland estrangement
from the church might mean exile from the
kingdom, under penalty of practical starvation if the
rebel tried to stick it out at home. Except that it
lacked the power to relax its heretics to the secular
arm for mutilation or death, the Scottish hierarchy
was own brother to the Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>In every parish the Kirk Session was supposed to
maintain a snooping committee to investigate the
conduct of the laity. The reckless parishioner who
desecrated the Sabbath by cooking a hot meal, by
puttering in his garden, or even by taking a walk,
was haled before the Session for discipline, and could
be reinstated in the communion only by confession
of his sin and payment of a fine. For more serious
offences the penalties were proportionately heavier,
unless one were wealthy or powerful enough to cow
the inquisitors. Burns had painfully intimate knowledge
of the cutty stool, or mourners’ bench, whereon
those guilty of fornication or other deadly sin had
thrice to appear before the congregation while the
minister rebuked them at length and with specific
detail. Girls sometimes committed suicide or murdered
their children to escape the public shame, and
the effect of the ordeal on those who submitted was
more likely to be hardening than chastening. Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
another youth besides Burns inwardly resolved
thenceforth to live up to the reputation thus fastened
upon him.</p>

<p>The Kirk frowned upon, and tried to suppress,
such secular amusements as music and dancing. In
spite of the ban, the custom of ‘penny weddings’,
whereby impecunious young couples in the rural districts
sought, by giving what was in effect a subscription
ball, to raise money enough to set them up in
housekeeping, still persisted; but even these gatherings
had a slightly furtive quality, and in the stricter
homes all such things were taboo. The moral results
of the policy of repression were almost wholly bad.
The older men, in default of other relaxation, devoted
themselves to drink; the younger, to the pleasures
that give its point to Burns’s simile, ‘as busy as
an Edinburgh bawd on a Sunday evening’.</p>

<p>Probably none but a native Scot can understand
the finer points of Scottish theology. Fortunately,
however, such understanding is not needed for a
general grasp of church affairs in the eighteenth century.
Primitive Calvinism shares with Marxism the
distinction of being the most completely deterministic
philosophy ever widely accepted in the western
world. All men were held to be equally sinful and
equally deserving of eternal damnation. ‘Adam as
the federal representative of the human race had determined
its fate once and for all by violating that
unfortunate covenant which he and the Deity had
contracted with regard to the forbidden fruit. A
vicarious sacrifice had indeed been offered; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
power to avail themselves of this expiation was to be
communicated to only a few of the minority to
whom it had been made known; and these were to
be saved to show that God was merciful, as the rest
were to be damned to show that He was just.’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This
was the creed of which Oliver Wendell Holmes said
that any decent person really holding it ought to go
mad out of mere self-respect. And like every other
rigid system it had the effect of stultifying its sincerest
adherents. The most patriotic of historians
are compelled to recognize the general intellectual
torpor of Scottish theological and philosophical
writing in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
The thinking of the clergy had been finished
for them by John Calvin and John Knox; all that
remained for them to do was to expound. No first-rate
mind can subdue itself to the mere unquestioning
exposition of other men’s views without losing
its edge, and few of the parish clergy in Scotland had
started with first-rate minds. Their preaching was
commonly a dreary reiteration of the doctrine of
the Four-Fold State of Man—first, Innocence or
Primitive Integrity, next Nature or Entire Depravation,
then Grace or Begun Recovery, and finally
Consummate Happiness or Misery—brightened
only by sadistic imaginings of the details of eternal
torment. As if these doctrinal limitations were not
sufficiently deadening, custom required that one of
the minister’s two discourses each Sunday should be
preached from his ‘ordinary’ text—which meant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>that he was expected to take the same text week
after week and torture it into new applications of
doctrine. If his invention failed under the strain, and
he changed his ‘ordinary’ too often, zealous parishioners
were likely to complain to the Presbytery.
Add to these handicaps the fact that few ministers
had money enough to buy books, even had they
wished for books, and one begins to realize why
Scottish manses two hundred years ago contributed

<p>Nevertheless the tides of changing ideas stirred
even the strongholds of Calvinism. Before the seventeenth
century ended Michael Wigglesworth in
Massachusetts had found himself compelled slightly
to modify the doctrine of infant damnation in the
direction of human decency; in Scotland the ‘common
sense’ doctrines of the Deists penetrated during
the eighteenth century even among those who abhorred
the name of Deism. From 1729 until his
death in 1746 Francis Hutcheson, as professor of
Moral Philosophy in Glasgow University, expounded
to steadily growing classes his theory of the ‘moral
sense’—an allegedly innate human capacity for distinguishing
right from wrong. This concept of innate
virtue as opposed to the idea of original sin
rapidly gained ground among the laity and the
younger clergy of the cities, despite bitter hostility
on the part of the conservatives. Preaching began to
stress conduct rather than the will of a cruel and
capricious god as the way of salvation. A healthier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and more prosperous nation was in fact rebelling
against a harsh and depressing philosophy, and the
clergy were following the lead of their congregations.
By the third quarter of the century the liberal faction,
the Moderates or New Lights, were in almost
undisputed control in the metropolitan districts,
though the fundamentalists, or Old Lights, still
flourished in the smaller towns and in the rural parishes.
The more rigorous extremes of kirk discipline
began to relax. Though in 1757 John Home was
compelled to resign his pulpit to escape the consequence
of having written <i>The Tragedy of Douglas</i>—to
witness the early performances of which a few of
his more daring clerical brethren disguised themselves
in the garments of the laity—the ban on the
theatre gradually sank into desuetude. Even while
the Edinburgh playhouse was still unlicensed, and
dramas had to be advertised as concerts of music
between the parts of which the play of the evening
would be presented gratis, it became possible for
ministers to attend the performances openly.</p>

<p>But the warfare of New Lights versus Old was not
conducted wholly in the realm of ideas. The fact
that the more influential laity were early converts
to the new doctrines brought into the struggle politics
in its most worldly form. In parishes where the
local magnates exercised the right of presenting the
minister, New Light candidates had the preference.
Hence it was the New Lights’ interest to uphold the
right of patronage against the congregation’s democratic
claim to elect its own minister. The supporters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
of patronage triumphed in the election of William
Robertson as Moderator of the General Assembly in
1763; the result made the church almost as much a
part of the spoils system as the government was, and
gave its leadership into the hands of supple ecclesiastical
politicians. In consequence the spread of New
Light doctrine went hand in hand with a steady decline
in the moral influence of the clergy, while
schisms and secessions sapped the organization. Because
the Kirk was morally as well as intellectually
bankrupt the laughter of Burns’s satires shook it to
its foundations. To the church of John Knox such
ridicule would have meant no more than a mosquito
means to an elephant. Burns’s Edinburgh
friends were right in maintaining that the conduct
and doctrines which he attacked would have disappeared
in another generation without his aid;
what neither they nor he could foresee was that in
1843 it would be the Old Light clergy who would
restore moral leadership to the ministry by daring
to give up their livings for conscience’ sake.</p>

<p>Behind the New Light doctrines expounded by
Hutcheson and his followers lay of course the ideas
of such English Deists as Locke and Shaftesbury.
Strong convictions on philosophical and theological
questions were going out of fashion; like Franklin
in America the New Light Scots had persuaded
themselves that enlightened self-interest, sweet reasonableness
and common sense, were attainable
goals for mankind at large, and could be trusted to
solve problems of morals and economics alike. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
this English influence in the field of theology and
philosophy was typical of the entire range of literary
expression in Scotland. The national inferiority
complex showed itself most plainly of all in the
realm of words.</p>

<p>Historically the Scottish language is to English
what Provençal is to French and Catalan to Spanish—an
ancient and independent local dialect
which had developed its own literature at least as
early as had the more central region which afterwards
took the lead. The speech of Lowland Scotland
was the direct descendant of that Northumbrian
dialect of Old English which Bede and
Caedmon spoke. Throughout the Middle Ages and
the early Renaissance Scotland maintained amid
her poverty as rich a literary tradition as England
did. In fact, from the death of Chaucer until the
beginning of the Elizabethan era the student of British
literature must look north of the Tweed to find,
in the writings of King James I, Robert Henryson,
Gawain Douglas and William Dunbar, anything
worthy the name of poetry. The decay of Scots as a
literary language was started by the Reformation
and finished by the Union. By introducing the Geneva
version of the English Bible the Reformation
made Southern English the language of the church,
in idiom if not in pronunciation. The accession of
James VI to the English throne made Southern English
also the language of the court. King James himself
wrote in Scots; his subject, William Drummond
of Hawthornden, wrote in English. Drummond’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
example was followed by all the prose writers and
most of the poets of Scotland from his day to ours.
After the Union even the poets who used Scots did
so consciously and not because such expression was
wholly spontaneous.</p>

<p>Of these poets, Allan Ramsay, whose productive
period covers roughly the three decades from 1711
to 1740, was the most popular. And Scots poetry,
as practised by Ramsay and by his friend and contemporary
William Hamilton of Gilbertfield, tended
more and more to what Samuel Johnson would have
described as the easy and vulgar, and therefore the
disgusting. Their work exhibits humour, and something
of the conversational quality of the familiar
essay, but dignity and deep poetic emotion are
notably absent. Moreover, the dialect in which they
wrote tended more and more to become a synthetic
and standardized language, embodying words and
idioms common to a large section of southern Scotland
but without firm roots in any one region. The
Aberdeenshire dialect used by Alexander Ross in
his <i>Helenore</i> is almost the last fresh transcription of
the speech of a definite section of the country. Written
Scots was rapidly becoming what nineteenth-century
English and American authors made other
dialects—a semi-literary vernacular employed for
humorous effect or for an affectation of colloquial
ease. Even Burns himself at times gave artificial
Scottish flavour to his verse by using English idioms
in Scottish spelling. Since the end of the eighteenth
century no writer of Scots verse has succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
introducing any new elements. At its best, such writing
sounds like imitations of Burns; at its worst, like
imitations of his imitators.</p>

<p>But when Burns came before the public even this
conventionalized literary Scots seemed on the point
of extinction. Though Ramsay’s <i>Tea-Table Miscellany</i>—which
included many purely English verses—was
still popular as a song-book, the rest of his work
was neglected. Hamilton of Gilbertfield’s recension
of Blind Harry’s <i>History of Sir William Wallace</i> was no
more than a story-book for children. The unhappy
Robert Fergusson, starved and neglected, had ended
his life in a madhouse, and fashionable Edinburgh,
glancing askance at his satirical verses, said it served
him right. Ramsay was a crude homespun figure of
the generation in which Thomson by writing <i>The
Seasons</i> had given his countrymen a poem which they
could show to Englishmen without blushing; ‘The
Daft Days’ and the rest of Fergusson’s work was
little better than a national disgrace when set beside
the beauties of James Beattie’s <i>Minstrel</i>. Nevertheless
there still underlay the new fashions a literary
tradition which most of the anglicizing gentry
scorned or ignored. An oral Scottish literature was
still alive, though it was soon to perish when its
lovers smothered it by writing it down. Percy’s
<i>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</i>, which first gave
highbrow sanction to the popular ballads of Scotland
and northern England, were not published
until Burns was six years old, and even Percy only
scratched the surface of this rich deposit. Throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
the century scores of ballads still circulated by
oral tradition which had never been recorded in
writing, and in these the genuine spirit of the Scottish
language flourished without concession to
fashionable English.</p>

<p>Even more important than the ballads for the
training of a poet like Burns were the folk-songs.
The Scots had always been a musical people, and
despite the opposition of the stricter clergy traditional
songs or airs for almost every human occasion
were known to everyone, high or low. The tradition,
moreover, was still very much alive. Scottish song
gave the nation its revenge for the military humiliations
of the ’45. The taunting lilt of ‘Hey, Johnie
Cope, are ye waukin yet?’ could be relied on to remind
English garrisons of the inglorious conduct of
their fellow soldiers at Prestonpans, and all Scotland’s
contempt for the Hanoverian kings and their
mistresses went into the ribaldry of ‘The Sow’s Tail
to Geordie’. Even so, only a fraction of the popular
songs had any political bearing. More of them were
convivial; many more of them erotic. Every phase
of sexual love from the crudest bawdry to idyllic
beauty found some expression in verse—the latter,
it must be confessed, more rarely and less effectively
than the former. Yet these crude songs, interesting
mainly for the surprising variety and ingenuity of
their erotic symbolism, were the raw material—raw
in more than one sense—from which Burns wrought
such lyrics as ‘My Love is like a red red rose’, ‘John
Anderson’, and ‘Coming thro’ the rye’. While Burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
was still a lad, David Herd, a retiring antiquary in
Edinburgh, began the systematic collection of this
folk poetry on so large a scale and with such a complete
absence of prudery that it was not until the
twentieth century that the whole of his manuscript
collection was printed. He had himself published in
1776 two volumes of what he considered the best
work. At the same time musicians like James Oswald
and Neil Gow were collecting the airs of Highlands
and Lowlands alike. The singing of the old songs,
with or without instrumental accompaniment, was
a favourite pastime in Scottish drawing rooms, and
even unliterary folk would frequently feel moved to
compose new words to some well-liked melody.</p>

<p>Alongside this honest love of native things,
whether expressed in a girl’s singing at her harpsichord
or in David Herd’s careful recording of old
words, another literature was growing up of imitation,
forgery, and ‘improvement’. It had become a
literary convention for every composer of an imitation
ballad to offer it to the public as a copy from
an ancient manuscript. Though a few of these imitations,
like the ‘Hardyknute’ of Lady Elizabeth
Wardlaw, were close enough to the spirit of folk literature
to deceive even experts, the mass of them
were so mawkish and verbose as to bring the term
‘Scottish poetry’ to the verge of contempt. Primacy
in these qualities, as in popularity, belonged to
James Macpherson’s alleged translations of the
poems of Ossian—a work passionately defended by
the Scots because it depicted their savage ancestors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
as a trifle more chivalrous and vastly more sentimental
than Bayard or Sidney, admired on the Continent
because it supported the current delusion
about the nobility of man in a state of nature, and
cherished by Napoleon Bonaparte as one of the
simple pleasures which appeal to the enterprising
burglar in his hours of relaxation.</p>

<p>But the harm done to traditional literature by
imitations and forgeries was trivial compared with
that inflicted by some of those people who professed
to admire it. In the latter part of the eighteenth century
the teaching of music in Edinburgh had passed
largely into the hands of foreigners. Names like
Domenico Corri, Pietro Urbani, and Theodor
Schetki are as prevalent on title-pages as their
owners were on the concert stage, and under this
Italianate influence many traditional melodies were
‘harmonized’ and ‘improved’ until all their native
vigour was lost in empty flourishes. And as with the
music, so with the words. ‘Correct’ and sentimentalized
lyrics were substituted for the sturdy old words,
remained in use long enough to push the latter into
oblivion, and then, their novelty gone, themselves
sank into disuse and dragged the music with them.</p>

<p>This effort to refine the national heritage of music
was merely one phase of the whole sense of provincial
inferiority which afflicted Scotland. Italian
music and English literature, speech, and manners,
were the ideals towards which genteel Scots strained.
National pride in James Thomson and John Home
exulted more in the fact that they wrote English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
acceptable in England than in their use of Scottish
materials. Even the devastating scepticism of David
Hume was forgiven him because he had almost
purified his language of Scotticisms. When Johnson
ridiculed Hume’s English Boswell writhed in agony,
and was correspondingly elated when the dictator
praised Blair’s sermons and was moved to tears by
Beattie’s <i>Minstrel</i>.</p>

<p>When Thomas Sheridan came to Edinburgh in
1761 to give a course of lectures on elocution, ‘he was
patronized by the professors in the College, by several
of the clergy, by the most eminent among the
gentlemen at the bar, by the judges of the Court
of Session, and by all who at that time were the
leaders of public taste’.</p>

<p>Thenceforward, ‘correct pronunciation and elegant
reading’ were reckoned ‘indispensable acquirements
for people of fashion and for public speakers’.
In other words, these people of fashion, like Francis
Jeffrey on his return from Oxford, gave up the
broad Scots in return for the narrow English. In the
very year of the Kilmarnock <i>Poems</i>, Sir John Sinclair
of Ulbster, one of the most public-spirited Scots of
his generation, brought out a two-hundred-page
volume of <i>Observations on the Scottish Dialect</i>. His purpose
was not to preserve but to destroy his native
speech. His book is a comprehensive index expurgatorius
of all the words, phrases, and idioms a Scotsman
must avoid—many of them today a part of the
standard speech of the United States, and even of
England. Thus, ‘best man’ is a Scotticism for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
‘bride’s man’; ‘hairdresser’ is to be preferred to
‘barber’; ‘sore eyes’ is a vulgarism; ‘whisky’ should
be called ‘usquebae’ or ‘aquavitae’. ‘Heather’ and
‘peat’ and ‘bracken’ are condemned along with
‘mittens’ and ‘kindling’; it betrays provincial origin
to ask if a friend is in, or if he has gone out walking.
‘It is, indeed, astonishing,’ says Sir John, ‘how uncouth,
and often how unintelligible, Scotch words
and phrases are to an inhabitant of London, and
how much it exposes such as make use of them, to
the derision of those with whom they happen to
have any communication or intercourse.’ However,
he adds, a Scot should choose carefully even from
the speech of London. ‘Cockney phrases a Scotchman
is very apt to get into when he makes his first
appearance in London. And when he can easily and
fluently bring out, <i>this here thing</i>, and <i>that there thing</i>,
for <i>this</i> or <i>that thing</i>; <i>I knode</i>, for <i>I knew</i>; <i>on it</i>, for <i>of it</i>,
as, <i>I heard on it</i>; <i>grass</i>, for <i>asparagus</i>; <i>your’n</i> and <i>his’n</i>,
for <i>yours</i> and <i>his</i>, he fancies himself a complete Englishman.’</p>

<p>The anglicizing mania extended even to people’s
names. David Malloch, when he crossed the Border,
changed his name to Mallet; John Murray the publisher
was originally M’Murray, as his predecessor,
Millan, had been Macmillan; William Almack, the
proprietor of the famous assembly-rooms in London,
had started life as M’Caul. One of Burns’s own
friends, James M’Candlish, dropped the prefix when
he entered Glasgow University, and became simply
Candlish. Even today, in spite of Burns, the anglicizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
process continues: the visitor in Ayr, for instance,
will find the street-signs pointing him to the ‘New
Bridge’ and the ‘Old Bridge’.</p>

<p>By 1780 Scotland could afford to smile at Johnson’s
dictum that her northern lights were only
farthing candles. In literature at least she could face
English competition on equal terms. James Thomson
had become a classic; Adam Smith and Hume
and Robertson had demonstrated that the north
could more than hold its own with the south in history
and philosophy; Mackenzie’s lachrymose <i>Man
of Feeling</i> disputed with <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i> the
claim to be the most popular short novel of the century.
In Edinburgh a <i>Scots Magazine</i> was emulating
the methods and materials of the English <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>, though when Mackenzie and his
friends tried, first in <i>The Mirror</i> and later in <i>The
Lounger</i>, to produce a Scottish <i>Spectator</i> they found
the city not metropolitan enough to support such
an enterprise. Many people took anything sharp in
the way of satire as a personal attack, but namby-pamby
was not read, and so between poverty of
material and poverty of support the journals’ straw-fire
flickered and went out.</p>

<p>But while the poor relations of England were thus
looking forward hopefully to the day when their
speech and writing should no longer betray their
provincial origin, the social life of the country
changed more slowly. The gentry added silks and
laces to their clothing, and tea and other luxuries
to their tables, but felt no special urgency for greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
cleanliness. George Dempster, fresh from a visit to
Brussels in 1756, was shocked to find that a baronet’s
son of his acquaintance had been calling on a lady
of title ‘in a valet de chamber’s frock and an unpowdered
brown greezy head’. Even at the beginning
of the nineteenth century the inhabitants of a
Highland mansion, though they had got beyond the
point where they were satisfied to give themselves
‘a “good wash” on Sundays, and make that do for
the week’, found their domestic routine upset by a
guest who not only insisted on a daily bath but refused
to go to the river to take it. Servants in the
better houses were provided with shoes and stockings,
but the general standards of neatness were still
so low as to make the cleanliness of Holland a constant
source of wonder to the visiting Scot.</p>

<p>But the aping of English manners had not yet
undermined the traditional Scottish democracy of
intercourse. Though the barriers which divided gentleman
from commoner were fully as strong in Scotland
as they were in England, they were not so
visible. If many of the gentry lacked wealth, they
did not lack pedigree, and a plebeian could rarely
hope to cross the boundary that excluded him from
social equality. Nobles married with nobles, and
lairds with lairds. Yet until the end of the century
the sons of nobles, lairds, and ploughmen commonly
began their education together in the village school,
where boy-fashion they took each other at face-value
without regard to rank. The result was an almost
total absence among the lower classes of that servility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
which was bred into their compeers in England.
Only as more and more of the sons of gentlemen
were sent to English public schools did the old system
decay, and some of the gentry begin to compensate
for the inferiority they had been made to
feel in the presence of the English by assuming a
haughty air with their humbler countrymen.</p>

<p>In short, all that had distinguished Scotland as a
nation was on the way to oblivion. Literature, language,
manners, and institutions were being anglicized
as fast as a people roused to uneasy self-consciousness
could manage it. In 1786 it seemed
evident that when the former things passed away
it would be into the darkness in which men and nations
prefer to bury the ruder and more discreditable
features of their early days. That the memory
of the discarded heritage should be embalmed as a
precious possession, and that the old world should
be forever surrounded by the romantic glory of a
golden sunset was due more to Robert Burns than
to any other person. He made the Scots conscious
of the richness of their national tradition. He could
not restore it to life, but he taught his people to
cherish its ruins.</p>

<p class="ph2">EDUCATION</p>


<p>Robert Burns was nearly nine years old before anything
revealing his personality impressed his family
enough to make them remember it. Unreliable tradition
has it that he was a puny infant; slightly better
evidence shows him as a nervous and temperamental
child, alternating between wild high spirits
and moody sullenness. Once, it is said, Robert hid
in a cupboard when he and his schoolmates were
frolicking. The master in restoring order struck the
door a resounding blow with his tawse, and the nervous
shock threw the child into such uncontrollable
hysterical sobs that he had to be sent home. But the
most devout worshipper would have trouble in discerning
a future poet in so undifferentiated an episode.
It is easier to do so in Gilbert Burns’s story of
what happened at Mount Oliphant one evening in
1768.</p>

<p>John Murdoch the schoolmaster had got a better
post, and was paying a farewell visit to the parents
of two of his promising pupils. As a parting gift, he
brought a copy of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>. Beginning to read
the play aloud, he soon came to the scene where her
ravishers taunt the mutilated Lavinia. The children,
in an agony of tears, implored him to read no more;
whereupon their father dryly remarked that in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
case there was no use in Murdoch’s leaving the
book. Robert exclaimed fiercely that if it was left, he
would burn it. Murdoch warded off the father’s rebuke
by commending the display of so much sensibility,
though he failed, then or later, to explain why
he considered <i>Titus Andronicus</i> suitable reading for
children. <i>The Man of Feeling</i> was not yet written, but
‘sensibility’ was already a word of power, and
Robert Burns was already displaying the stormy
emotions which were his to the grave.</p>

<p>Murdoch’s farewell marked the end of Burns’s
elementary schooling, but the education of a boy
reared as he was cannot be appraised in terms of
mere schooling. If it could, the whole story might be
told in a few paragraphs. Burns’s real education
came from his family, from what the world taught
him, and from what he taught himself. His schooling
was incidental.</p>

<p>The poet once had the curiosity to visit the Herald’s
Office in Edinburgh, only to discover that
‘Gules, Purpure, Argent, &amp;c., quite disowned’ him—no
man of his name had ever borne coat armour.
The nearest he could come to it was ‘Burn’. Inquiry
into his ancestry is fruitless, because nothing in his
ancestry explains Burns, any more than the dull line
of squires into which he was born can explain Shelley,
or a London livery-stable Keats. Burns’s family
produced no genius before him; it produced none
after him. It is enough to record that William
Burnes, the poet’s father, came of peasant stock
from the eastern Lowlands of Scotland. The poet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
cherished the belief that some of his forebears had
been out in the ’Fifteen in the train of George Keith,
tenth Earl Marischal, but documentary proof is
lacking. The poet’s grandfather, Robert Burnes,
farmed, apparently with indifferent success, in Kincardineshire,
first on the farm of Kinmonth, in
Glenbervie, and later at Clochnahill, Dunnottar.
Robert Burnes’s second farming venture having
failed in 1747, his son William (born 1721) set out in
the following year with his younger brother, Robert,
to seek work.</p>

<p>William Burnes had had some training as a gardener,
and found his first employment in Edinburgh.
By 1750, however, he was in Ayrshire, where,
after brief service on two other estates, he finally
entered the service of Provost William Fergusson,
laird of Doonholm in Alloway parish. These frequent
moves were not wholly the result of unsettled
labour conditions. Pride and self-assertiveness handicap
the man doomed to subordination, and these
traits William Burnes possessed in full measure.
‘Stubborn, ungainly Integrity’, said Burns of his
father, ‘and headlong, ungovernable Irascibility are
disqualifying circumstances’. William Burnes needed
to be his own master, and in 1757 managed to ‘feu’
(lease in perpetuity) seven acres of land a few hundred
yards north of the ruined old Kirk of Alloway.</p>

<p>Besides longing for a farm of his own, William
Burnes wanted a wife and a home. Seven acres of
market-garden, supplemented by continued part-time
employment at Doonholm, made marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
possible. With his own hands he raised the rammed-clay
walls of a cottage on his land—a cottage which
his younger son declared, with more emphasis than
the timid Gilbert usually permitted himself, to be
‘such as no family of the same rank, in the present
improved style of living, would think themselves ill
lodged in’. From without, the whitewashed walls
and thatched roof of the ‘clay biggin’ were picturesque
enough; within, it was damp, dark, and narrow,
and smelly withal, for the byre and stable were
under the same roof of rat-infested thatch. But such
rural Scots as lived to grow up in those days were
inured to dampness, smells, and vermin, and it was
probably with unmixed pride that William Burnes
and his wife set up housekeeping in December,
1757.</p>

<p>The bridegroom was ‘advanced in life’; he was in
fact almost as old when he married as his famous
son was when he died. His red-haired bride, twelve
years his junior, was Agnes Broun of Kirkoswald.
The daughter of a small farmer, she had been accustomed
from childhood to the life of toil which
marriage intensified. Her girlhood as housekeeper
for her widowed father and manager of his younger
children had given plenty of domestic training, but
formal education was too great a luxury for girls; the
mother of Scotland’s greatest poet was never able to
write her own name. She had, however, a sort of
literary education more valuable for her son than
savouring at first hand the dullness of Boston’s <i>Fourfold
State</i> could have been. Blessed with a sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
humour, a retentive memory, and a keen ear, the
girl had stored her mind with a wealth of ballads,
folk-songs, and country sayings which later became
an integral part of her son’s thought and art. The
seeds of the poet’s imagination and wit were his
mother’s; William Burnes’s most conspicuous contribution
to his son’s character was his fierce and
prickly pride.</p>

<p>A little more than thirteen months after his parents’
marriage, on January 25, 1759, Robert Burns
was born. The Scottish winter was doing its worst—‘a
blast o’ Janwar’ win’ blew handsel in on Robin’. In
other words, a few days after the poet’s birth a wild
Atlantic gale tore out part of the clay gable of the
cottage where it had settled unevenly round the
stone jambs of the chimney. Mother and baby had
to be carried through the storm to a neighbour’s
house, where they sheltered until the damage could
be repaired. To Burns in later years the incident
seemed an augury of his own stormy life. The world
had begun to educate him to its harshness almost before
he knew that he was in it. Fortunately he had a
father who was determined that his children should
also have an education in the more conventional
sense.</p>

<p>Though Scotland theoretically provided a free
school in every parish, the usual gap separated theory
and practice. Sometimes there was no school at
all; often the school was an unsanitary hovel presided
over by a master who was expected to live on
a salary of perhaps ten or fifteen pounds a year, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
who therefore was constantly driven to desperate
shifts to provide for himself and his family. John
Wilson of Tarbolton, for instance, the victim of
‘Death and Dr. Hornbook’, tried to eke out his meagre
earnings by starting a little grocery shop in his
cottage, and in 1790 was ready to undertake the
drudgery of a legal copyist in Edinburgh in order to
better his condition. After the close of the century,
when every parish was ordered by Act of Parliament
to provide its schoolmaster with a house of at least
two rooms, some lairds objected to erecting ‘palaces
for dominies’. And even when a parish had a decent
schoolhouse and a competent teacher, bad roads
and lack of conveyance often made it impossible for
children from outlying farms to reach it.</p>

<p>When William Burnes built his cottage at Alloway
the fact that there was no school nearer than
Ayr would scarcely have worried him. His own
book-learning was sketchy, his writing cramped and
laborious, though his speech was more precise and
‘better English’ than that of most of his neighbours.
But he was devoutly religious, and cherished the
sound Presbyterian conviction that first-hand acquaintance
with the Scriptures was essential to
knowledge in this world and salvation in the next.
By the time his eldest son was six years old the
father, conscious of his own inadequacy as a teacher,
arranged with half a dozen neighbours to hire a
master of their own. Their choice fell on John Murdoch,
a solemn and pedantic youth of eighteen, who
in mentality somewhat resembled Ichabod Crane.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
For wages of about sixpence a day and his board—which
meant a share of the oatmeal and kail and
part of a bed in each crowded cottage in turn—Murdoch
undertook to instruct his charges, not
without tears, in the three R’s and also in such elementary
music as would enable them to sing the
Psalms of David in metre at family worship.</p>

<p>In this latter accomplishment he found Robert
Burns, who in manhood was able to remember and
distinguish in all their subtle variations hundreds
of folk melodies, an almost hopeless pupil with a
harsh and untuneable voice. At the task of beating
into the future poet the elements of spelling, grammar,
and syntax he was more successful. Instruction
in reading was based largely on a volume of extracts
compiled by another Scottish schoolmaster named
Arthur Masson—good enough literature for the
most part, but too declamatory to be really within
the grasp of a six- or seven-year-old intelligence.
Robert’s first conscious realization of poetic experience
came from Addison’s hymn, ‘How are Thy
servants blest, O Lord’: he also memorized the ‘Fall
of Cardinal Wolsey’ and other set pieces so thoroughly
that throughout his life their phrases came
unbidden from his pen. If Murdoch found difficulty
in making the children understand the poetic merits
of Hamlet’s soliloquies or of long passages from
Home’s <i>Tragedy of Douglas</i>, he at least convinced
some of them that poetry had meaning. One of his
favourite exercises was making them paraphrase
poetry into straight-forward prose—a device which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
his most famous pupil subsequently employed in exposing
bad grammar in a female admirer’s verses.</p>

<p>Murdoch was not the man to set a poetic child’s
imagination on fire, and since he applied the usual
schoolmasterly standard of judging the pupils according
to their docility, it is hardly surprising that
he found the timid and gentle Gilbert a more promising
lad than his brother. In any case, Murdoch’s
service was too brief to have much permanent influence
on Burns’s mind. Before the master had completed
his tenure of about two years and a half at
Alloway, William Burnes had removed to Mount
Oliphant farm, separated from the school by two
miles of sodden road which must have made regular
attendance difficult, and sometimes impossible. Yet
the master retained a sort of puzzled affection for the
boy whom he was too prosaic to understand, and
Burns reciprocated the feeling with real respect and
esteem. Murdoch, in the schoolroom and in the long
evenings in what he called the argillaceous fabric or
mud domicile at Alloway, had at least impressed the
lesson that books had meaning and that words
should be used with precision. That Burns in later
life never had any difficulty in saying precisely what
he meant, he probably owed at root to Murdoch’s
severe drill; that his style of saying it was frequently
much too formal he likewise owed to the dominie
and to the prose selections of Arthur Masson.</p>

<p>The earliest stages of book education are seldom
important in shaping the maturity of the learner.
They only furnish him with a few tools which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
may later apply in his own way to his own ends.
But with Burns the whole pressure of his formal education
was all his life in direct conflict with his instinctive
preferences. For John Murdoch, as for
Arthur Masson, Scottish vernacular literature did
not exist. Scottish writers like James Thomson and
John Home, who had made reputations in England
by writing in standard English, were admired to the
far side of idolatry, but for Scottish youths, as for
English, Pope was the model for poetry; the <i>Tatler</i>
and <i>Spectator</i> for prose. Shakespeare, Milton, and
Dryden were the only writers earlier than 1700 who
were widely read and unreservedly admired, though
the beginnings of romanticism were evoking some
lip-service to Spenser. If Chaucer was read at all, it
was in the modernizations and imitations of Dryden,
Pope, and Prior; the Elizabethan and Caroline
lyrists were safe sources for newspaper poets to steal
from, as Sterne stole from Burton. By modern standards,
the amount of native literature needed in order
to appear well-read was limited, but its very limitation
intensified its pressure. Poverty kept Burns from
the influence, for good or ill, of the classics; nothing
could preserve anyone, who read at all, from the influence
of the neo-classics. Outside the door the rich
vernacular literature of Scotland was still vigorously
alive, but no schoolmaster in Burns’s boyhood would
have dreamed of letting it in.</p>

<p>This literature, indeed, was being steadily thrust
further out of the cultivated world. Two years before
the poet’s father was born, Lady Elizabeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Wardlaw had written the ballad fragment of
‘Hardyknute’ with genuine folk skill; in the next
generation such interest as remained was contaminated
with literary sophistication. The gentlefolk
of William Burnes’s generation could no longer
write true ballads, but they could and did write true
folk-songs, as witness Jean Elliot’s ‘Flowers of the
Forest’, Alison Cockburn’s ‘I’ve seen the smiling of
Fortune beguiling’, and John Skinner’s ‘Tullochgorum’
and ‘John o’ Badenyon’. The gentlefolk of
Robert Burns’s generation had lost this power too.
Burns was six years old when Percy’s <i>Reliques</i> inaugurated
the serious study of popular literature and
let loose the spate of forgery and imitation of which
Macpherson’s <i>Ossian</i> was the most brilliant success.
The national will to believe in Macpherson’s fabrication
was proof alike against the scorn of Dr. Johnson
and the learning of antiquaries. To many Scots
besides Burns Ossian was the ‘prince of poets’, to be
read and admired as a patriotic duty, even if few
of his vague and turgid phrases could be remembered
long enough to quote. And what Macpherson
did on the grand scale ballad ‘editors’ like John
Pinkerton were doing on a small one, debasing even
their genuine material with sentimental trash which
blinded many readers to the merits of a really honest
and accurate editor like David Herd.</p>

<p>But all this activity, alike of forgery and of honest
collecting, never touched Burns in his formative
years. In the boy’s world the folk literature which
David Herd was recording was still alive. It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
favourite fallacy of the half-educated to identify
book-learning with education. The things which
made the mind and the art of Burns did not come
from John Murdoch, but from people whom Murdoch
no doubt patronized in his most schoolmasterful
style. Agnes Broun was illiterate, but she was not
ignorant. Like most intelligent illiterates, she had
cultivated her memory, storing it with the pithy sayings
which sum up generations of folk experience,
and with the words and music of scores of old songs
and ballads. These simple rhythms, sung as she went
about her work, sank into her son’s mind without
his knowing it. Years afterwards some chance association
would recall an old line or stanza of his
mother’s to supply the ‘starting note’ for a song of
his own. And her repertoire was powerfully supplemented
by old Betty Davidson’s, who ‘had the
largest collection in the county of tales and songs
concerning devils, ghosts, fairies, brownies, witches,
warlocks, spunkies, kelpies, elf-candles, dead-lights,
wraiths, apparitions, cantraips, giants, enchanted
towers, dragons and other trumpery’. To these tales,
listened to with delighted shudders, he ascribed the
first awakening of his imagination, even though some
of them scared him so thoroughly that their effect
stayed with him into manhood. No doubt many a
gentleman’s son heard similar stories from nurses
and servants, but formal classical education effectually
smothered any idea of putting them to literary
use. Sir Walter Scott was almost the first child
of the upper ranks to realize his folk-heritage, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
probably he owed much of his freedom to do so to
the interruption of his scholastic training. Ill-health
saved him from formalism, as poverty saved Burns.</p>

<p>Burns’s acquaintance with popular and traditional
literature was not, however, limited to what
he heard at home. The eighteenth century was the
heyday of the chapbook and the broadside—forms
of popular literature resulting from the spread of
literacy among the middle and lower classes, which
were finally swept away by the newspaper. In
Burns’s childhood every peddler’s pack contained an
assortment ranging from topical songs and reports
of the death and dying words of the latest criminal
to abridgements of old histories and romances. Even
the poorest labourer could afford the penny or two
these publications cost, and they passed from hand
to hand until they were worn out. William Hamilton
of Gilbertfield’s modernization of Blind Harry’s
<i>History of Sir William Wallace</i>, which so roused
Burns’s boyish patriotism, may have reached the
lad in chapbook form; the Life of Hannibal which
he also mentions was almost certainly a chapbook;
he was familiar from his earliest years with such
ephemera as ‘The Aberdeen Almanac’ and ‘Six Excellent
New Songs’. But he nowhere mentions another
group of writings which he assuredly read.</p>

<p>Only a few years before Burns was born, Dugal
Graham, the hunchbacked bellman of Glasgow,
began publishing a series of Scottish chapbooks.
Their popularity was enormous; total sales are alleged
to have run into the hundreds of thousands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
The most pretentious of Graham’s works was a
metrical history of the ’45; the most characteristic
were the humorous prose tales such as ‘Jocky and
Maggie’s Courtship’, ‘The Adventures of John
Cheap the Chapman’, and ‘The Comical Sayings of
Paddy from Cork’. These chaps were made up of
traditional anecdotes of a broadly comic sort, loosely
strung together but supplied by Graham with the
local colour of Scottish peasant life. Much of Graham’s
material had a long history; coarse jests which
go back at least as far as Chaucer; folk-tales of unquenchable
vitality, such as the one on which Synge
long afterwards based <i>The Shadow of the Glen</i>; quaint
figures of speech and wild exaggerations, some of
which crossed the Atlantic to become the progenitors
of the American ‘tall story’. The peasant world
as Graham depicted it was tough and crude and
unlovely, but full of a coarse vitality which enlivened
even the baldest passages of Graham’s prose
and which at its best expressed itself in pungent
phrases remembered and used by Burns, probably
long after he had forgotten their source. The most
indecorous stanza in ‘Holy Willie’s Prayer’ is based
on a phrase from ‘Jocky and Maggie’s Courtship’,
as is a similar stanza in ‘Death and Doctor Hornbook’.</p>

<p>But the peasant life of Scotland, however squalid
its physical circumstances as Dugal Graham portrayed
them, had a variety of interest unknown to
the modern dweller in a city slum. When the technique
of all the varied crafts necessary to rural life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
had to be learned by example and oral tradition,
the whole process of living was an education. Almost
as soon as they were able to walk the children began
to take their part in the work of the farm. At the
age of six or thereabouts the boys would be helping
to guide the four-horse team which dragged the
clumsy plough; not long afterwards they began to
share in reaping, threshing, and winnowing, besides
doing the innumerable and endless small chores of
the farm. These tasks, with all their accompanying
observations of plants and animals, of weather and
seasons, were stronger influences on Burns than
John Murdoch was. No poet has revealed a closer
or more accurate knowledge of nature; no poet, it
may be added, had less of romantic enthusiasm for
pure scenery. Burns knew nature as the peasant
and the savage knows it, as something on which his
health and prosperity and his very life depend.
Readers who are surprised that Burns spent much of
his youth in sight of the noble peaks of Arran without
ever mentioning them in his verse simply fail to
understand the realism of the peasant’s point of
view. It was not the dalesmen who won a hard living
from valley farms or kept their sheep on the bleak
mountainsides who found the poetry in the Lake
District. Had Burns been reared on Loch Lomond
or at Aberfoyle it would have made no difference;
he would have been too busy trying to wring a living
from the soil to note the scenery. That had to wait
for Sir Walter Scott, who had nothing to do but
admire it. Even when he had won fame and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
consciously accepted his vocation as a national poet
Burns paid only lip-service to scenery as scenery.
For him it was merely background for human figures,
preferably female. The spots which really
stirred his emotions were those with associations of
history or song—Cawdor Castle, the field of Bannockburn,
Elibanks and Elibraes, the Bush aboon
Traquair. And the fact that so many of the folk-songs
of Scotland celebrate the streams whose valleys were
the only fertile spots may have fostered the love for
running water repeatedly expressed in his poetry,
as it certainly roused him to do for the streams of
Ayrshire what his anonymous forerunners had done
for the streams of the Border.</p>

<p>Not all the boy’s education, however, was thus
casual and informal. When his removal from Alloway
to Mount Oliphant made it impossible for his
sons to continue regular schooling William Burnes
procured a few textbooks such as Guthrie’s <i>Geographical
Grammar</i> and Stackhouse’s <i>History of the
Bible</i> for their instruction. Despite the burden of
farm work the father managed at times to set regular
lessons to be conned at evening by the light of
the kitchen fire or a tallow dip. Robert and Gilbert
helped to teach their younger brothers and sisters to
read and write; their own lessons included the use of
a brief religious catechism which their father had
himself prepared with Murdoch’s help, for William
Burnes was a devout man. Even in boyhood Burns,
said Gilbert, was a reader when he could get books.
He read whatever he could get his hands on, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
dull or ponderous it might be, from theology to
poetry. His own lists in his autobiography, highly
selective though they are, are proof enough. His first
knowledge of classical mythology, for instance, came
from Andrew Tooke’s <i>Pantheon</i>, an appallingly dull
and didactic outline of Greek and Roman religion.
He never had Keats’s good fortune in discovering
the Elizabethans: his Homer was Pope’s and not
Chapman’s. But he reached manhood with a working
knowledge of history and geography, a keen interest
in current affairs, and an acquaintance with
literature which, though spotty, was the more detailed
because of its relatively narrow limits.</p>

<p>William Burnes’s effort to educate his children at
home was part of a family struggle which became
one of the strongest influences in forming his son’s
character. The usual destiny of the children in a
peasant family was to be hired out at the age of ten
or twelve as farm servants. This fate, with its breaking
of ties, cessation of schooling, and frequent moral
danger, William Burnes was determined to avoid if
possible. He was a stern father, but an affectionate
one. John Murdoch remembered his wrath at a labourer’s
‘smutty innuendoes’, and his children knew
that carelessness in word or deed would be sharply
rebuked. But they likewise remembered many acts
of wordless affection, as when during a thunderstorm
the father came to sit with his daughter Agnes
because he knew she would be frightened.</p>

<p>When it became evident that the few acres at Alloway
could not continue to support his growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
family, William Burnes rented from his old employer,
Provost Fergusson, the larger farm of Mount
Oliphant. Gilbert Burns, who seldom used superlatives,
declared that Mount Oliphant was almost the
poorest land he had ever seen in cultivation. Yet for
its seventy bleak and stony acres William Burnes
undertook to pay £40 a year for the first six years of
his lease, and £45 for the next six. It may not be too
uncharitable to assume that the Provost saw in the
tenancy of the stubbornly independent Burnes a
chance to get a poor farm raised to a better level of
cultivation. At any rate he showed his confidence
in his tenant by advancing a hundred pounds towards
stocking the place. Without this help the venture
would probably have been impossible; nevertheless
it saddled the family with an additional load
of debt. The weight of the burden can be realized
from the fact that in the 1770’s in nearby Clydesdale
twopence a dozen was a fair price for eggs, and
chickens sold for sixpence a pair. Despite all handicaps,
however, things went fairly well for the first
half of the lease. In 1771 the family failed to take
advantage of their privilege of relinquishing the
farm, and accordingly were committed to another
six years at an increased rental. Then began the
series of disasters which ultimately killed William
Burnes and permanently undermined the health of
his eldest son.</p>

<p>Just at the onset of these dark days William
Burnes, vexed at his children’s bad handwriting,
managed to send Robert and Gilbert, turn about, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Dalrymple parish school for instruction in penmanship
and grammar, that they might be better qualified
to teach their brothers and sisters. By the following
summer (1773), John Murdoch had returned
to Ayr and Robert was spared from the farm for
three weeks’ additional tutoring. The lad clutched
at the opportunity like a famished man at food. He
was with Murdoch ‘day and night, in school, at all
meals, and in all [his] walks’. At the end of the first
week, Murdoch says, ‘I told him, that as he was now
pretty much master of the parts of speech, &amp;c., I
should like to teach him something of French pronunciation;
... and immediately we attacked the
French with great courage. Now, there was little
else to be heard but the declension of nouns, the
conjugation of verbs, &amp;c. When walking together,
and even at meals, I was constantly telling him the
names of different objects, ... so that he was
hourly laying in a stock of words, and sometimes
little phrases. In short, he took such pleasure in
learning, and I in teaching, that it was difficult to
say which of the two was most zealous in the business;
and about the end of the second week of our
study of the French, we began to read a little of the
<i>Adventures of Telemachus</i> in Fénelon’s own words.’
How much French Murdoch really knew is doubtful,
though he later undertook to teach it in London,
and apparently secured some pupils until the Revolution
filled the city with refugees who captured
the market. Burns ultimately acquired a reading
knowledge of the language, but if his riming ‘<i>respectueuse</i>’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
with ‘Susie’ is a specimen of the pronunciation
Murdoch taught he would scarcely have made himself
understood in Paris.</p>

<p>Murdoch was this time most favourably impressed
by Robert’s ability, and, in his own inimitable language,
regretted that at the approach of harvest
‘Robert was summoned to relinquish the pleasing
scenes that surrounded the grotto of Calypso, and,
armed with a sickle, to seek glory by signalising himself
in the fields of Ceres; and so he did, for although
but about fifteen, I was told that he performed the
work of a man.’ Murdoch had seen no signs of the
qualities which Burns afterwards declared made him
as a child by no means a favourite with anybody; in
his eagerness for learning he displayed only the retentive
memory and the enthusiastic ardour which
would have most endeared him to the pedantic master.
The ‘stubborn ungainly something’ which later
ripened into pride was filling him with smothered
rebellion against his lot in life; the weeks with Murdoch
opened for a moment a door through which it
seemed that he might escape. He was becoming
class-conscious, and was developing a hatred of stupid
wealth and power which never left him. His
earliest associations with the sons of the gentry had
not been unpleasant, for these lads had not yet acquired
‘a just sense of the immense distance between
them and their ragged Playfellows’. ‘My young
superiours’, he said, ‘never insulted the clouterly
appearance of my ploughboy carcass, the two extremes
of which were often exposed to all the inclemencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
of all the seasons.’ They gave him stray
volumes of books; one lad even helped him with his
French. Nevertheless, he could remember in manhood
how as a mere child he almost choked with
rage in church one Sunday at the sight of a pretty
servant-lass being compelled to leave her pew to
make room for the stupid son of her employer.</p>

<p>About the time of his last association with Murdoch
he began to have occasions for rage without
going to church for them. Provost Fergusson died in
1771, and the administration of his property fell into
the hands of a steward or factor. Fergusson had
probably been lenient if his tenant could not make
payment in full on each quarter-day, but it was the
factor’s business to get in the rents, and if they were
not paid he wrote threatening letters to demand
them. It is always difficult for a debtor to see things
from the creditor’s point of view; for Robert Burns
it was impossible. For him the factor was a scoundrel,
and his dunning letters were deliberate efforts
to humiliate the unfortunates in his power. Not but
what the Burnes family had reason for feeling resentful.
They were doing everything that was humanly
possible, and more than was wise, to meet
the factor’s demands. They lived very poorly, even
by Scottish peasant standards; meat was almost unknown
on their table; they gave up all hired help.
At the age of fourteen, as Murdoch noted, Burns
was doing a man’s work, guiding the clumsy plough,
flailing out grain by hand, and performing all the
other tasks at which brute strength had to serve not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
merely instead of machinery but instead of well-made
tools. His gait became the clumsy tread of the
ploughman; his young shoulders developed a permanent
stoop from handling the awkward plough-stilts.
But the worst physical effect was invisible.
The adolescent boy doing a man’s work on insufficient
food was incurably injuring his heart. When
the lesion began to manifest itself in dizziness and
faintness Robert was not sent to a doctor. Probably
it would have made no difference if he had been, for
the trouble could scarcely have been diagnosed
without a stethoscope. Instead he used heroic measures
which must have aggravated the ailment. At
one time he kept a tub of water beside his bed, and
when faintness came on him in the night he would
take a cold plunge. All his life he was plagued with
fits of depression which he described by the fashionable
term, hypochondria. His heart lesion intensified
the nervous instability he had shown as a child,
and thereby contributed to the perennially reckless
conduct of his manhood. In all his life, as in his
death, he continued to pay the heaviest share of the
price of his father’s struggle to hold on at Mount
Oliphant.</p>

<p>A boy seldom realizes that he is overstraining
himself. What irked Burns at the time, far more than
‘the unceasing moil of a galley-slave’, was the fact
that he was almost wholly cut off from social intercourse.
Burns may not have been wholly an extrovert,
but he needed society as an outlet for his high
spirits and as a refuge from his low ones. In his earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
boyhood he had found friends both among
schoolfellows of his own rank and among the sons of
neighbouring gentlemen. At Mount Oliphant he
was cut off. Murdoch would come out on his half-holidays,
‘with one or two persons more intelligent
than [himself], that good William Burnes might enjoy
a mental feast’. This conversation of ‘solid reason,
sensible remark, and a moderate seasoning of
jocularity’ was not what the boy needed. Robert
and Gilbert ‘began to talk and reason like men,
much sooner than their neighbours’, but this precocious
maturity only made the lad more acutely
conscious of his own lack of advantages. He envied
the greater ease and assurance of his more fortunate
fellows, and out of this envy and self-consciousness
grew the aggressive manner upon which some of the
gentry later remarked with disfavour.</p>

<p>As William Burnes’s tenure at Mount Oliphant
neared its end the clouds opened a little. The father
had never wholly abandoned his hope of providing
his eldest son with some sort of education, and in the
summer of 1775 managed to send him for a few
weeks to learn ‘dialling and mensuration’ at Kirkoswald.
Superficially the venture seemed as fruitless as
the earlier effort to learn French in three weeks. The
master, Hugh Rodger, was as pedantic as Murdoch,
but inclined to be harsh and sarcastic where Murdoch
was earnest and encouraging. Though Burns
acquired some practical mathematics which later
proved useful in his Excise work, he found the more
vivid part of his education outside the classroom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
With William Niven, a classmate of his own age, he
indulged in spirited impromptu debates on such
adolescent topics as ‘Whether is a great general or a
respectable merchant the most valuable member of
society?’ With a girl named Peggy Thomson he fell
in love briefly, but so violently as to disorganize his
work during his last days at school. Above all, he got
glimpses of a sort of life very different from the seclusion
of Mount Oliphant.</p>

<p>In the later eighteenth century smuggling rated
as one of the major British industries. An excise tax
of twenty shillings a gallon on spirits set an even
higher premium on illicit dealing than prohibition
did in the United States in the 1920’s. Few of the
‘best people’ had any more scruples about dealing
with smugglers than Americans had about dealing
with bootleggers. Nor was smuggling confined to liquors.
Tea, French silks and laces, and other goods
on which the tariff was high were also run in in
quantity. The coast near Kirkoswald was a centre
for landing goods intended for the Ayrshire and
Glasgow markets because it was almost the last
point smuggling vessels could approach without
grave risk of being trapped by the revenue cutters
in the narrow waters of the Firth of Clyde. Samuel
Brown, the uncle with whom Burns stayed at Kirkoswald,
probably had a quiet share in the business;
at any rate his nephew saw plenty of smugglers. In
the taverns where these men spent the profits of their
successful ventures Burns witnessed roistering of a
wilder sort than market nights at Ayr exhibited. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
extremely limited means, however, make it improbable
that he often looked unconcernedly on a large
tavern bill, though ten years later he thought he
had. More likely the awkward youth was a spectator,
as the poet was at Poosie Nansie’s in 1785. A
Shakespearian delight in the salty flavour of raw
humanity was one of Burns’s life-long characteristics
which first found expression at Kirkoswald. In
1783 he wrote to John Murdoch, ‘I seem to be one
sent into the world, to see, and observe; and I very
easily compound with the knave who tricks me of
my money, if there be anything original about him
which shews me human nature in a different light
from anything I have seen before.’ His respectable
friends often deplored what seemed to them a depraved
taste for low company, but, as his best friend
in Dumfries explained, it was not the lowness of the
company that attracted him; his companions were
of ‘low ranks, but men of talent and humour’. It was
the colour of such company, its shrewdness, its reckless
wit, and its unashamed gusto for life that made
Burns prefer it to the drab respectability of the
church-going bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>Crude humanity, however, was not the only
thing Burns studied at Kirkoswald. He encountered
some new books as well. Thomson’s <i>Seasons</i> introduced
him to the chief Scottish poet of the century
who had made his reputation by writing in standard
English; Shenstone’s ‘Elegies’ and ‘The Schoolmistress’
initiated him into the poetry of sentiment, and
the Spenserian stanza of the latter gave him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
verse-form for ‘The Cotter’s Saturday Night’. In
reading these poets, however, he was merely extending
an acquaintance already made through the
specimens in Arthur Masson. His prose reading
opened a different world. Novels were not to be
found in the stricter Presbyterian homes, so <i>Pamela</i>,
an odd volume of <i>Ferdinand Count Fathom</i>, and above
all Mackenzie’s <i>The Man of Feeling</i>, were a vivid experience.
Nothing in his previous training had inoculated
him against the virus of sentimentality; exposed
to its most extreme form, he was infected for
life. This, the lad no doubt said to himself, was the
way persons of superior sensitivity looked upon life;
very well, he could prove that his sensibility was
equal to theirs. At the first opportunity he bought a
copy of <i>The Man of Feeling</i> and carried it with him
everywhere until he wore it out.</p>

<p>Had Burns known more of literature and of the
world he would have been able to take Mackenzie’s
sentiment at the proper discount. Then the book’s
influence might have been good. It might gently
have corrected the harshness of his peasant background,
as the literature of sentiment in general
ameliorated the brutality of the eighteenth-century
world. As it was, the book set up a preposterous ideal
which divided Burns’s energies and sometimes vitiated
his work. The crudities of peasant life needed
softening and elevating, but sentimentalism made
many of his efforts in this direction mawkish instead
of humane. The poet who portrayed an old farmer’s
affection for a faithful mare was revealing sentiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
in the best sense of that much-abused word; the poet
who moralized over a ploughed-under weed was
pumping up emotions such as no real farmer ever
felt. Hence it is no exaggeration to say that the foundations
for the weakest elements in his work, as well
as for the magnificent zest of ‘The Jolly Beggars’ and
‘Tam o’ Shanter’, were laid at Kirkoswald.</p>

<p>Burns was probably right in saying that he came
home considerably improved. But he was also discontented.
Mount Oliphant seemed narrower and
drabber than ever after the colour of the smuggling
village, and he had become acutely conscious—thanks
equally to Peggy Thomson and to his tavern
companions—of his own awkwardness. This consciousness
led him to his first overt act of rebellion.
In ‘absolute defiance’ of his father’s commands, he
attended a country dancing school, to improve his
manners. William Burnes’s ‘Manual of Religious
Belief’ indicates a willingness to mitigate some of the
sterner points of Presbyterian theology, but he was
in full agreement with the Kirk’s condemnation of
worldly amusements. Gilbert Burns, as well as some
of his brother’s biographers, tried to explain away
the remark about defiance, and the father may not
have pressed the point too far when he saw that
Robert’s mind was made up. Undoubtedly, however,
Burns was correctly describing his own feelings
at the time, and though the father sensibly accepted
the accomplished fact and later allowed his other
children to learn dancing he thenceforth regarded
his eldest son’s conduct with suspicion and concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>On leaving Kirkoswald Burns had undertaken to
carry on a literary correspondence with some of his
schoolfellows. He was bent on improving his powers
of expression and acquiring a literary style. But the
medium he selected was prose. Probably in retrospect
he exaggerated the actual extent of this correspondence—it
is hard to believe that ‘every post’
brought him as many letters as if he had been a merchant,
or that he could have paid the postage if it
had. The few surviving specimens are quite enough.
The poet’s uncle had once set out to buy one of the
manuals of letter-writing which supply models for
most of the imaginable contingencies of human life;
he brought home instead ‘a collection of letters by
the Wits of Queen Ann’s reign’. The exact volume
has never been identified, though Burns’s subsequent
quotations show that it included letters of
Pope, Bolingbroke, and Swift. But the eighteenth
century, until Boswell taught it better, did not publish
really familiar letters. Such collections as Pope
helped to bring out were really composed of brief
essays. Personal opinion was subdued; personal news
was deleted. The ‘unbridled effusions’ which make
the charm of familiar letters were suppressed. On
such unfortunate models, almost as stiff as Elizabeth
Rowe’s ‘Letters Moral and Entertaining’ which he
had found in his Masson, Burns set to work. The result
was the same as when he encountered <i>The Man
of Feeling</i>. A youth bred among literate people would
have realized intuitively that these models showed
only one side of letter-writing. Burns, with no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
standards to measure them by, took them as the
whole of the law and prophets, and shaped his epistolary
style accordingly. His ear, attuned to the
subtlest modulations of poetry, remained always
deaf to the quieter graces of prose: when Dugald
Stewart commended the simplicity of Franklin’s
writing, Burns could see nothing in it, ‘when compared
with the point, and antithesis, and quaintness
of <i>Junius</i>.’</p>

<p>Those who have judged Burns adversely as a
letter-writer would have still more grounds for their
criticism had more letters survived like the few to
William Niven and Thomas Orr. These country
youths admired Burns’s solemn analyses of Pride and
Courage and his exhortations to be content with
poverty; so, unfortunately, did the better-educated
friends of his later life. The letters which he transcribed
for Lady Harriet Don in 1787 and for
Robert Riddell in 1791-93 belonged to the same
school of prose as his earliest epistles to Niven.
Burns would never have thought of making, nor his
friends of asking for, transcripts of the admirable
discussions of Scottish song which he sent to George
Thomson, nor of his easier letters to John Ballantine
and Mrs. Dunlop. No epistolary Robert Fergusson
ever came into his hands to show him the way to a
conversational style. When he wrote easy prose it
was in spite of his models and because he had something
to say which really demanded saying.</p>

<p>When the family at last escaped from Mount Oliphant
in 1777 Burns was eighteen, the age at which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Chatterton, seven years before, had taken his own
life. But Burns’s self-education was a much slower
process than Chatterton’s. At eighteen he was still
an awkward rustic, with all his intellectual and artistic
powers still to find. The most positive result
of the long ordeal at Mount Oliphant—apart from
its injuries to his health—had been the building up
of a strong sense of family loyalty. William Burnes
had made every sacrifice to keep his family together,
and the feeling that this was a primary obligation
had been deeply impressed on his son. For the moment
their prospects seemed hopeful. The father had
managed to lease the larger farm of Lochlie near
Tarbolton, and had again obtained from his landlord
a cash advance for stock and improvements.
But again Burnes was paying the penalty of his
desperately independent character. For Lochlie’s
hundred and thirty acres of sour clay—so sour that
the lease provided for two separate applications of
lime at the rate of 400 bushels to an acre—its putative
owner, David M’Lure, set a rental of £130. It
was a ruinous bargain which broke William Burnes’s
spirit, helped to kill him, and gave his children some
first-hand acquaintance with the chicanery of the
law.</p>

<p>On Burns the first effect of the removal to Lochlie
was social. The farm was within easy reach of Tarbolton
village, where he found the companionship
his nature craved. Of his friends at Mount Oliphant
James Candlish’s is the only name that has not perished;
those of the Tarbolton cronies are enshrined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
in both verse and prose. For the first couple of years
the records are almost blank. By his own testimony,
and Gilbert’s, he was constantly falling tempestuously
in love, usually with girls of his own rank, or
below it, for ‘he had always a particular jealousy of
people who were richer than himself, or who had
more consequence in life’. His imagination could
always endow any girl to whom he was attracted
with a plentiful stock of charms which bystanders
often failed to perceive. His ready pen, moreover,
was constantly at the service of his less fluent friends
who sought his aid in composing their love-letters,
and he ‘felt as much pleasure at being in the secret
of half the amours in the parish, as ever did Premier
at knowing the intrigues of half the courts of
Europe.’ But Gilbert’s testimony corroborates his
own statement that none of these early affairs passed
the bounds of decorum. The fervours which he had
first experienced when reaping with Nellie Kilpatrick
at the age of fifteen were growing stronger
and more clearly defined, but they were still
adolescent.</p>

<p>This adolescent Burns figures also in the proceedings
of the Tarbolton Bachelors’ Club, a social and
debating society which he and a few friends organized
in the autumn of 1780. Its fragmentary records
show the youths arguing such windy topics as Burns
had discussed with Niven five years before, but with
a more direct application to his own walk of life.
E. g., ‘Whether is the savage man or the peasant of a
civilized country, in the most happy situation?’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
‘Whether is a young man of the lower ranks of life
likeliest to be happy who has got a good education,
and his mind well informed, or he who has just the
education and information of those around him?’
‘Whether between friends, who have no reason to
doubt each other’s friendship, there should be any
reserve?’ Such topics point to Burns as their propounder,
as do some of the Club’s rules. The one
which barred religious topics was doubtless in the
interest of peace, but Burns’s hand is evident in the
tenth and last:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Every man proper for a member of this society must
have a frank, honest, open heart; above anything dirty or
mean; and must be a professed lover of one or more of the
female sex. No haughty, self-conceited person, who looks
upon himself as superior to the rest of the club, and especially
no mean-spirited, worldly mortal, whose only
will is to heap up money, shall on any pretence whatever
be admitted....’</p>
</div>

<p>Indecorum of language was likewise barred, and
clerical biographers in discussing these rules have
left the impression that the Club was a kind of
Y.M.C.A. From what we know of peasant life in
Scotland and of the adolescent male everywhere, it
is possible that the biographers were mistaken.
Whatever his conduct in 1780, Burns was soon
applying the tenth rule in no platonic or idealistic
sense.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Club played an important part
in developing his powers. Besides giving him an audience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
for his ideas it showed him that he could
dominate his audience. Thenceforward Burns took
the lead in any social group where he was intimate;
his companions, re-echoing his wit, believed that
they shared it and even convinced him that they
did. The roster of his friends includes many wholly
commonplace people like John Richmond and
Robert Ainslie who shone only by reflected light, but
whose satellite nature Burns was quite unaware of
at the time. Moreover, the Club gave him almost his
first experience of the wine of applause, and he found
it a heady vintage.</p>

<p>Among the Tarbolton Bachelors was David
Sillar—not a charter member of the Club, but admitted
to it early in 1781. A year younger than
Burns, Sillar, under his friend’s inspiration, produced
a few commonplace poems which gave Burns
the excuse for hailing him as brother poet. Sillar
had a certain gift for characterization in prose; he
described Tarbolton townsfolk as ‘uncontaminated
by reading, conversation, or reflection’, and left the
most vivid extant picture of Burns on the threshold
of manhood. Burns was beginning to reveal the playboy
elements in his nature—that desire above all
things to be conspicuous which he shared with such
very different geniuses as Sir Walter Scott, Charles
Dickens, Mark Twain, and Bernard Shaw. In a day
when strict Presbyterians still cropped their hair,
after the fashion which in the previous century had
earned them the name of Roundheads, Burns let
his grow long and wore it in a queue—‘the only tied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
hair in the parish’. When everyone else was wearing
plaids of ordinary shepherd’s gray, Burns sported
one of dead-leaf colour. And since the uncontaminated
parishioners of Tarbolton were orthodox Old
Lights Burns acquired easy notoriety by setting up
as a heretic.</p>

<p>Throughout his life Burns managed always to acquire
a maximum of ill-repute with a minimum of
actual transgression. It was not so much that he was
conspicuously sinful as that he sinned conspicuously.
Sometimes the conspicuousness was mere ill-luck. A
fair portion, for instance, of the Edinburgh gossip
which clung to his name may well have originated
in the fact that both the servant girls with whom he
had relations in the city brought legal action against
him—a consequence he could scarcely have foreseen.
On the other hand, his desire to startle the parish
frequently bore fruit in suspicions and enmities
impossible to live down. G. K. Chesterton once advised
the village genius who wants to conquer something
fundamentally and symbolically hostile and
also very strong, not to come up to London but to
stay at home and have a row with the rector. This
was precisely what Burns did. The New Light doctrines
which soft-pedalled such Calvinistic dogmas
as predestination had already conquered Edinburgh
and Glasgow and were beginning to invade the
provinces. In any case Burns’s saturation in the
sentimentalism of Mackenzie and Sterne would have
made him receptive to the New Light emphasis on
Benevolence and the Moral Sense. But when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
congeniality of the new doctrines was joined with
an opportunity to startle his neighbours the combination
was irresistible. He began, he says, to debate
theology with such heat and indiscretion as to
raise a cry of heresy which persisted in Tarbolton
and Mauchline as long as he remained there. An
anecdote, perhaps apocryphal, pictures him in the
kirkyard between services, expounding heretical
doctrines with such vigour as to elicit hisses and
cries of ‘Shame!’ from his auditors. At least the story
is true in spirit. Burns was determined to be conspicuous,
even if it meant hisses instead of applause.</p>

<p>Masonic affiliations, which after his return from
Irvine supplanted the Bachelors’ Club, gave him still
another chance to indulge both his social instincts
and his sympathies with liberal thought. A rural
lodge like St. James’s at Tarbolton was, to be sure,
no such centre of political liberalism as were the
Masonic lodges of the Continent during the later
eighteenth century. The chief activity, in fact, of
most of the Scottish lodges seems to have been convivial,
with the additional feature, lacking in the
ordinary social club, that the members were pledged
to help their fellows in sickness or distress. Nevertheless
the knowledge that brother Masons in England
and abroad were disseminating ideas which challenged
absolutism in government and religion must
have reached even village youths in Tarbolton. In
Scotland, moreover, the ritual which dignified the
childish thrill of membership in a secret organization
gave Freemasonry an emotional appeal which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
drab services of the Kirk and the narrow routine of
every day lacked. From the time when he joined
St. James’s Lodge, about 1782, until after his sojourn
in Edinburgh, Burns took his Masonic duties
with the utmost seriousness. He helped to put the
struggling and almost bankrupt lodge on its feet;
from 1784 to 1787 he was its Depute Master. In
Edinburgh he continued his affiliations, and perhaps
the highest moment of all his early triumphal
progress in the capital came at the meeting of the
Grand Lodge of Scotland on January 13, 1787,
when the Grand Master gave the toast, ‘Caledonia,
and Caledonia’s Bard, brother Burns!’ It is idle to
conjecture if the coolness which followed his first
acclaim in Edinburgh reached into Masonic circles;
certainly the poet’s interest in the craft waned in his
later years. His letters from Ellisland and Dumfries
scarcely mention it, except when he was in trouble
and wanted Robert Graham to help him as a Mason
as well as a friend. He duly affiliated himself with
the Dumfries lodge, and became its Senior Warden,
but if silence means anything the zest was gone.</p>

<p>The Masonic fellowship of course was male, but
Burns was not forgetting his obligations as a member
of the Bachelors’ Club. His own statements and
Gilbert’s, already quoted, show a succession of passing
infatuations with various girls whose names,
even, are doubtful, and of whose personalities the
most ardent legend-mongers can scarcely summon
up a wraith. By comparison with such shadows as
Anne Rankine and Mary Morison, even Nellie Kilpatrick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
who stirred the poet’s blood for a single
harvest, and Peggy Thomson, who overset his trigonometry
at Kirkoswald, are three-dimensional. The
one figure who half emerges from the shadows is
Alison (or Ellison) Begbie. Burns met her in 1780 or
1781, but understanding of the matter is not clarified
by the possibility that some of the five letters
supposed to have been addressed to her may really
be drafts of the love-letters he frequently wrote for
his friends. Assuming them all to be Alison’s, they
prove mainly that Burns had not yet learned much
about women. If ever farm-lass was wooed in such
stilted and temperate phrases it is pretty certain that
she was not in this humour won. Burns’s intentions
were serious; he wanted to marry Alison. Unfortunately
the intentions made him serious too. He
seemed afraid to commit himself in writing. A
bystander is not surprised that Alison refused the
man who told her that her company never gave him
those giddy raptures so much talked of among lovers,
and who announced that in his opinion married
life was only friendship in a more exalted degree.
It did surprise Burns. Indeed the shock of it led him
subsequently to charge her with having jilted him,
a difficult feat when his own letters prove she had
never accepted him. No doubt she had merely employed
the ancient technique of mild and noncommittal
encouragement while she was making up
her mind. Burns had prided himself on his skill in
letter-writing and on his address with women. To
be flatly rejected the first time he made a serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
proposal upset him for several months. It also completed
his sentimental education. Thereafter, until
he met Clarinda, he knew better than to do his
courting by post.</p>

<p>But friendships with men and women, though
they helped him momentarily to escape his blue
devils, could not obscure the problem of his own
and his family’s future. He still lacked an aim.
Conscious of more than average powers in himself,
he had no purpose to which to direct them. Moreover,
the years at Lochlie were bringing him for the
first time to a realization of the workings of the
larger economic laws. The American War was ruining
the West of Scotland. Half its market for manufactured
goods was closed; its exports to the West
Indies were being raided by American privateers.
Just before the war an over-expanded bank had
failed, dragging down with it half the gentlemen in
Ayrshire and leaving a trail of wreckage which was
not wholly obliterated for a couple of decades. Even
the wartime demand for farm produce was no help
when multitudes of jobless artisans could not pay
the high prices which at best would scarcely have
yielded a fair return on the over-capitalized land.
M’Lure, the landlord of Lochlie, was heavily mortgaged
to the defunct bank. Hard pressed for cash,
he tried to extort from his tenants more than was
his due. William Burnes resisted, and became involved
in litigation which followed him to the grave.
In similar circumstances at Mount Oliphant Burns
had seen merely a personal situation in which a villainous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
factor was demanding more rent than the
family could pay. Now he began to realize that a
man may be frugal and diligent in his business, and
yet be destroyed by forces which he did not start
and was powerless to control.</p>

<p>As early as 1780 Burns had experimented at
growing flax of his own on a few acres of land subleased
from his father; later he won a prize for his
seed. His success led him in 1781 to go to Irvine to
learn the trade of flax-dressing. Some consequences
of that venture belong in the next chapter; educationally
the results, like those of so many youthful
experiences, were mainly negative. His distaste for
the work, and its ill effect on his health, left him
more aimless than before. He concluded that he was
unfit for the world of business, and where he had
formerly yearned for some chance of advancement
he now decided that he was destined to be only a
looker-on at life. All that restrained him from
complete shiftlessness was his sense of responsibility
for his family.</p>

<p>Intellectually, that sense was keener and more insistent
than ever, but now for the first time it was
in direct conflict with a storm of emotions. Burns
had come home empty-handed as the prodigal, to
find his father visibly sinking under the united effects
of worry and tuberculosis. It was plain that
even if his contest with his landlord should be decided
in his favour he would never be fit to undertake
another farm. By the beginning of 1783 the
whole family, including William Burnes, realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
that death was at best a matter of months. M’Lure
the landlord realized it too, and such scenes as had
accompanied the reading of the factor’s letters at
Mount Oliphant were re-enacted at Lochlie with
triple poignance. The children were old enough
this time to understand the whole meaning of the
affair; their father was a broken man, and where the
factor had merely threatened legal action, M’Lure
was taking it. The outcome of the case and the
practical means whereby Gavin Hamilton helped
the family through the crisis will be told later; its
emotional impact on Burns himself, coming as it did
on the heels of his own failure at business, could
hardly be overstated. He saw his father’s lifetime of
struggle for independence ending in defeat and
despair. Recollection of Mount Oliphant and Lochlie
never ceased to haunt his own ventures as a
farmer, and helped to damn them. Fear and hatred
of one’s economic position are seldom the heralds of
success.</p>

<p>Burns’s whole nature, in fact, was beginning to
cry out against the life he was expected to lead.
Not even the loyally accepted burden laid upon
him from his father’s weakening hands could hold
him steady. He had come back from Irvine, as before
from Kirkoswald, incapable of fitting again
into the narrow pattern of the life he had lived before
his departure. He had outgrown his mould. The
dying father noted with concern that his son was
spending longer hours with wilder companions, and
displaying a new aggressiveness and assurance in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
manner of speaking with women. Nevertheless the
shadow of the old man’s authority was still enough,
when reinforced by the desperate need of securing
the future of the family, to inhibit the full expression
of the new tendencies. Gilbert’s testimony is explicit.
At Lochlie he and Robert were both allowed
the usual labourer’s wage of £7 a year, against
which was charged the value of every piece of clothing
manufactured at home. Neither there nor at
Mossgiel did Robert’s expenditures exceed this frugal
sum. It was extravagance of emotion, of speech and
conduct, not of expense, that beset the poet.</p>

<p>On his deathbed, on February 13, 1784, William
Burnes muttered that there was one member of his
family for whose future conduct he feared, and
Robert, in tears, took the admonition to himself.
Hardly was the family settled at Mossgiel, after
some strictly legal dodging which must have increased
the poet’s inward distaste for the whole business,
when the traits his father had dreaded began
their full play. Though he entered on his responsibilities
as head of the family with the best of resolutions,
his heart was not in the undertaking. He read
farming books, calculated crops, and attended markets,
but his mind was elsewhere. According to his
own account, he lost interest in the work because of
two successive crop-failures, the first owing to bad
seed and the second to a wet harvest. But this was
an excuse, not an explanation. The real reasons lay
within himself. They were his passions and his art.</p>

<p>His father’s death had removed the last check<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
upon social indulgence. Always shunning the solitude
which produced brooding melancholy, he had
found in Mauchline a new and gayer set of cronies
whose company was more congenial than that of
his family in the crowded cottage at Mossgiel.
More and more of his time was spent in the village
taverns—not for drunkenness, but for the pleasure
of sharing the hilarity of careless youths and the uninhibited
wit of older ‘men of talent and humour’
like his neighbour John Rankine. The rigidly righteous
began to frown on the young farmer whose
reckless sallies were sure to provoke the wildest outbursts
of laughter. And even at Mossgiel there were
distractions from a sober and godly life. The household
included a young servant-lass named Betty
Paton, whose charms, like those of most of Burns’s
sweethearts, were mainly physical. Within a few
months of his father’s death Betty became Burns’s
mistress, and in May, 1785, bore his first child amid
all the accompaniments of a public scandal in the
parish.</p>

<p>Unpropitious though such beginnings were for a
career as a tenant farmer, they were relatively unimportant
compared with the inner compulsions
arising from his discovery of his poetic vocation.
Many another young farmer had sowed his wild
oats and then settled down to rear a legitimate
family and become an elder in the Kirk. For Burns
such a future had really ceased to be possible even
before he left Lochlie. In April, 1783, under the
melancholy influence of his own ill-health and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
father’s dark prospects, he had begun to keep a
commonplace book with the avowed intention of
some day showing the world that a young ploughman,
little indebted to scholastic education, was
nevertheless capable of rime and reason. When he
started the book his literary models were Shenstone,
Mackenzie, and the folk-songs of his country. At
some time during the next year, however, the poems
of Robert Fergusson came into his hands. They
roused him as Chapman’s Homer roused Keats.
For the first time he realized that the Scottish dialect
might be something more than a dying relic of
the past. He had been long acquainted with Allan
Ramsay, but Ramsay belonged to the primitive
age before Scottish letters had been ennobled by
such geniuses as Henry Mackenzie, James Beattie,
and John Home. Now he found that Fergusson,
only ten years older than himself, had returned to
the speech and the verse-forms of Ramsay. And
Fergusson was no country boy but an educated
lawyer’s clerk bred in the Athens of the North.
Reading these poems Burns realized their vivid descriptions
and their wit—realized also that what
Fergusson had done he could do as well, or better.
Mauchline parish offered as many themes for
homely satire as Edinburgh did.</p>

<p>The theme ready to hand was ecclesiastical controversy.
The neighbourhood was ululating with disputes
between Old Lights and New Lights, and the
leaders on both sides were behaving with the lack
of charity peculiar to Christians on the war-path.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
Moreover, Burns’s landlord and friend, Gavin
Hamilton, was in the thick of it, standing trial before
the Kirk Session on a charge of Sabbath-breaking.
Two neighbouring Old Light ministers—John
Russell of Kilmarnock and Alexander Moodie
of Riccarton—chose this time for a quarrel over
parish boundaries, and conducted their holy row
with the heat and personal invective of a heresy-hunt.
Burns improved the occasion by composing
‘The Twa Herds’. Copying the poem in a disguised
hand he showed it to Hamilton, remarking with
studied gravity that he had no idea who the author
was, but that he thought it pretty clever. Hamilton
thought so too. Copies were passed from hand to
hand; the New Lights, clergy as well as laity, received
it with roars of applause; the Old Lights
were correspondingly furious.</p>

<p>When Burns followed up ‘The Twa Herds’ with
‘The Holy Fair’, ‘The Ordination’, and ‘Holy
Willie’s Prayer’, the applause redoubled, and so did
the enmity of the Old Lights. The man who challenges
established institutions to their face needs to
be sure of his own position. Burns’s indiscretion
with Betty Paton not only left him wide open to
counter-attack but assured him of far more unpleasant
notoriety than ordinarily accompanied such
lapses in peasant Scotland. It was impossible to remain
in the parish without submitting to the discipline
of the Kirk. Even at its mildest the ordeal
of three successive penitential appearances before
Mauchline congregation would have been intensely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
humiliating to a man as sensitively proud as Burns.
But a young bachelor’s slips from grace were not
usually treated very seriously except by the clergy
and the Holy Willies. Had Burns been otherwise in
good standing in the community he would have
been able to go on much as before, but when the
evidence of his breach of sexual morality was augmented
by his ill-fame as a derider of the church he
became, among all the more conservative members
of the parish, little better than an outcast.</p>

<p>He may not have realized the full bitterness of the
feeling against him until his repudiation by the
Armours in the spring of 1786, but he realized
enough. His reaction was as inevitable as the community’s
had been. If he was to be an outcast he
would live up to his reputation. Many of his biographers
since, as well as many of his neighbours at
the time, have taken at face value the blatant pride
in his ill-repute which marks such poems as the
‘Epistle to John Rankine’. But this was not part
of his real nature; he was simply brazening out his
humiliation. The unco guid had decided that he
was a dog with a bad name. He would show them
that they had underestimated his capacity to shock
them. That in the process he would make the parish
too hot to hold him was a consideration not likely to
occur to him in the full tide of his resentment.</p>

<p>But if his conflict with the Kirk had brought him
humiliation it had also brought him the sense of
power and the intoxication of applause. He had
long known that his conversational wit and fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
could dominate a knot of cronies. Now he had
learned that he could write things which stirred
both the laughter and the deeper emotions of educated
men as well as of his social equals. The hostility
of the Holy Willies was even more inebriating
than the applause of Gavin Hamilton and his
friends. Men do not hate unless they fear; the measure
of his success and power was the measure of the
antagonism he had aroused. The youth whose
weakness it had always been to lack an aim had
found one now. His education was complete. Intimate
observation and experience of a small community
had acquainted him with human nature,
and had at last roused him to realization of his own
capacities and his true vocation. His estimate of
himself and his work, he later told John Moore,
was pretty nearly as high in 1785 as it was two
years later, after all the adulation of Edinburgh.
All that he needed now was the opportunity to display
his talents on a larger stage.</p>

<p class="ph2">MEN</p>


<p>Burns entered on his manhood at Irvine in 1781.
Before his ill-starred venture as a flax-dresser he
was an aimless and inarticulately rebellious youth;
after it, though he was still aimless for a time, his
rebellion against the narrow world of his origin was
overt and vocal. Yet even under the stimulus of
Irvine he was long in finding his proper speech.
When he wrote the earliest of his extant letters,
Burns, already a man in years, was still a boy in
mind. His self-conscious disquisitions on such high-resounding
themes as Pride and Courage mark him
as less mature at twenty-one than Chatterton was
at sixteen; he had passed the age at which Keats
died before he began to say anything worth heeding.
At twenty-two, his vague aspirations momentarily
focussed on the idea of establishing himself in business
as a necessary prelude to matrimony, he made
his sole attempt at living according to the standards
of a working-day world. Materially, the attempt was
an abject failure; spiritually, it set him on the direct
road to realizing himself.</p>

<p>Knowledge of the material side of the Irvine partnership
is limited to what Burns himself told in his
autobiographic letter, which is not wholly reliable
evidence. Not that Burns intentionally coloured the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
facts. The safest rule in reading his letters is to take
it for granted that if he said a thing about himself
it was true; if he said a thing about someone else,
he believed it to be true. But to his passionate temperament
and ‘skinless sensibility’ (the phrase is his
own) anyone through whom he suffered loss or
humiliation became almost automatically a villain
of the blackest. Hence his charges that Peacock, his
Irvine partner, ‘was a scoundrel of the first water,
who made money by the mystery of thieving’, need
not be taken literally. Burns, a complete greenhorn
at business, may possibly have been taken in by an
unscrupulous rascal, but it is equally possible that
Burns in retrospect blamed Peacock for a failure in
which they were both at fault. In any case, the business
side of these months influenced Burns’s future
only as it convinced him of his unfitness for ‘the little
chicaning art of bargain-making’. What really
mattered were the new friends, and the new ideas
of himself and his place in the world inspired by
these friends and by the introspection resulting from
ill-health.</p>

<p>Chief of the new friends was the sailor, Richard
Brown, whom Burns looked up to as a junior schoolboy
looks to the athletic senior. Brown was about
the poet’s age, but had all the worldly experience
Burns lacked. He was better educated than most
seamen of his day, though perhaps his story of having
been patronized by a wealthy man who promised
to set him up in life was only another sailor’s
yarn. He had at any rate abilities of a sort. An incompetent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
man could not have become the master
of a West Indiaman while still in his twenties. But
in 1781 that promotion was still to win. Brown just
then was down on his luck. His ship had recently
been captured by an American privateer, and he
had been put ashore on the coast of Connaught
with nothing but his life and the clothes he wore.
Nevertheless the friendship with Burns probably
began with something of patronage on Brown’s part.
The experienced, far-travelled, and distinctly hard-boiled
sailor was interested in the awkward, stoop-shouldered
country lad who in company alternated
between sullen silence and—if he felt himself at
ease—unusually vivid and copious speech. Obviously
Brown realized that there was something in
him; obviously also he took pleasure in enlightening
him as to the ways of the world. Burns saw in Brown
‘every noble, manly virtue’ and strove to imitate
him. Burns was already proud; Brown taught his
pride to flow in proper channels—whatever that
may mean. But Brown also was the only man the
poet ever met who was a bigger fool than himself
where women were concerned. The various goddesses
by whom Burns’s tinder heart was continually
lighted up still roused a hobbledehoy calf-love,
as adolescent as his hero-worship of the sailor.
Brown taught him that direct action might usually
be counted on to bring results, and here, as Burns
later admitted, the friendship did him a mischief.</p>

<p>Yet Brown was something more than a hard-boiled
sailor initiating a green youngster. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
Sunday afternoon the pair took a walking trip to Eglinton
Wood, where under the inspiring influence of
a spot associated with the memory of Sir William
Wallace Burns confided to his mentor that he occasionally
tried to write poetry. He was already poet
enough to have a copy in his pocket. Brown listened,
and declared that verses of such merit ought to be
sent to a magazine. It was actually this, Burns recorded
long afterwards, that first gave him the idea
that he might amount to something as a poet. It
was one thing to have one’s verses praised by a rural
maiden like Nellie Kilpatrick or by one’s own admiring
family; it was quite another to have them
endorsed by a man of the world. Unfortunately
Burns failed to name the poem Brown commended.
At a guess it may well have been the two somewhat
bawdy stanzas beginning ‘I murder hate by field or
flood’, Andrew Dunlop’s manuscript of which was
headed, ‘On the great Recruiting in the year 17— during
the American war’. Burns had no motive for
mystifying Dunlop; hence the date of these stanzas
can scarcely be later than 1781, and Brown would
have been more likely to applaud such lines than
the conventional religious pieces more or less contemporary
with them.</p>

<p>The good as well as the ill of Brown’s friendship
belongs to the six or eight months at Irvine. If the
friends met during the next four or five years, no
references to their intercourse survive. When the
Kilmarnock <i>Poems</i> were published, Brown received
the only inscribed presentation copy on record, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
in December, 1787, the two began a correspondence
which lasted for a couple of years in the intervals of
Brown’s voyages. Their only recorded meeting, however,
was in Glasgow in February, 1788, when the
poet told Brown all about Jean Armour. Burns’s last
letter, in November, 1789, in reply to a complaint
about his silence, is as cordial as ever, yet the friendship
ended. According to tradition, Burns’s charge
about Brown’s moral influence had reached the
sailor, now a married man with a steadily improving
position to maintain and far from eager to be reminded
that he had heard the chimes at midnight.
After Brown’s death, the presentation copy was
found hidden away in the back of an old sideboard.
The sailor was not the only friend who in later
years wanted to live down his associations with the
poet. The descendants of John Wilson concealed for
more than a century the fact that instead of resenting
‘Death and Dr. Hornbook’ he appealed to Burns
for help when his position as schoolmaster at Tarbolton
became intolerable. On the other hand, James
Humphry of Mauchline continued till his dying day
to boast that he was ‘Burns’s bletherin’ bitch’.</p>

<p>During the same months in which Brown was stirring
Burns to a new self-confidence his health was
producing opposite effects. Throughout his life his
diseased heart reacted unfavourably to nervous stress;
the Irvine experience was the first of many. Realization
of his bad bargain with Peacock combined with
the unaccustomed strain of dusty indoor labour to
bring on a period of ‘hypochondria’—in other words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
nervous depression resulting from defective heart-action.
Its tangible results were such lachrymose
verses as the ‘Prayer in the Prospect of Death’ and
the letter to his father in which he announces that
he is ‘quite transported at the thought that ere long,
perhaps very soon, I shall bid an eternal adiew to all
the pains, and uneasiness, and disquietudes of this
weary life; for I assure you I am heartily tired of it.’
The letter is not merely morbid, it is adolescent;
and Mrs. Carswell has noted that the solemn announcement
that ‘I am not formed for the bustle of
the busy nor the flutter of the Gay’ is cribbed verbatim
from <i>The Man of Feeling</i>. William Burnes,
however, probably regarded it as admirable proof
that his son was beginning to take serious views of
religion and life. In any case it represents only a
passing mood of ill-health. The important fact
about the Irvine days is that Burns was considering
seriously his own abilities and his future position.</p>

<p>The partnership had at least the merit of a dramatic
and even spectacular finish. A New Year’s
Eve celebration, whatever it may have done for
Burns, brought his partner and his wife to such a
state of drunkenness that they knocked over a lamp
and set fire to the shop. The place was completely
burned out, and after a month or two Burns returned
to Lochlie poorer than he went, but with a
rich store of experiences, a new outlook on life, and
a mature confidence in himself which he had never
before possessed. But he still lacked an aim. For
another four years the pride which Brown had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
taught to flow in proper channels was still to display
itself mainly in obscure rebellion against his
lot in life, and in anything but obscure defiance of
the unco guid.</p>

<p>The situation confronting him at home would in
any event have matured him, but without Irvine
it might have been in a different way. Firmly convinced
as always of his own justice and rectitude—a
conviction which he imparted with equal vigour
to his eldest son—William Burnes was closing his
long series of misfortunes in a violent contest with
his landlord, David M’Lure. The dispute had begun
in a difference over their respective shares of
the expenses of liming and fencing the farm and
erecting new buildings. Pending arbitration of the
case, William Burnes had held up payment of his
rent. In September, 1782, the matter was submitted
to James Grieve of Boghead and Charles
Norval of Coilsfield—chosen respectively by M’Lure
and Burnes—for adjudication. When they were unable
to agree, John Hamilton of Sundrum was
chosen as ‘Oversman’ or referee. Not until August,
1783, did Hamilton complete his analysis of the
accounts and hand down his decision, which was
that of £775 claimed by M’Lure, £543 was offset
by credits for improvements made by Burnes, part
payments on rent, and other items. But before this
decision was rendered M’Lure, whose estates were
heavily mortgaged to the defunct Douglas and
Heron Bank, and who desperately needed cash, had
tried to force payment by entering a sequestration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
on the stock and crops of Lochlie. By the time John
Hamilton reported, M’Lure was so deep in debt
that it was uncertain whether the rent belonged to
him or to his creditors. Thereupon indomitable
William Burnes carried the case to the Court of
Session at Edinburgh. His first petition being
thrown out on a technicality, he renewed it, and
at last, on January 27, 1784, less than three weeks
before his death, won his case. He had had the cash
on hand to deposit with the court, when he made
his appeal, the whole amount due; the decision absolved
him of further responsibility in the matter,
and summoned the various claimants to bring in
their claims for adjudication. William Burnes had
vindicated himself; his view of his obligations had
been upheld by the highest court in the land. All
that it had cost him was the last of his money and
the last of his strength. He was not an old man, but
the long struggle for livelihood, culminating in the
protracted lawsuit, made him the easier prey to
tuberculosis. His conviction of his own rightness, like
his irascibility, grew stronger as his body weakened,
and mingled with his wrath at M’Lure was anxiety,
bluntly expressed, over Robert’s growing defiance
of Presbyterian decorum.</p>

<p>In calmer circumstances, his father’s displeasure
would have weighed heavily on the poet’s mind,
but now he was looking beyond it. Watching their
father’s sinking health, the children were consulting
with each other about their future. The end of
Lochlie could not be long delayed: death would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
evict them, because after the litigation none of the
claimants to the property was likely to give them a
renewal of the lease. Though Robert subsequently
gave Gilbert the credit of being a full partner in the
next undertaking, he probably was not. It is difficult
to imagine the timid and subservient Gilbert
taking the lead in anything. Not long after returning
from Irvine Burns had made the acquaintance of a
prosperous Mauchline lawyer named Gavin Hamilton,
who may have been attracted to the young
farmer by reports of his outspoken ridicule of the
Old Lights in the Kirk. Hamilton being also a
Mason, they doubtless met first in the fellowship of
square and compass. The lawyer, already in hot
water with his more orthodox neighbours, may also
have realized the potential value of Burns’s wit in
the impending contests, but whatever his motives it
was Hamilton who suggested to William Burnes’s
children a practical and legal way out of their
trouble.</p>

<p>Several years before, Hamilton had rented Mossgiel
farm, about three miles from Mauchline, and
had rebuilt the cottage as a country retreat. The
plan of being gentleman farmer as well as lawyer
had palled, and Hamilton now offered to sublet
Mossgiel to Robert and Gilbert at a lower rental—£90
a year for 118 acres—than they were paying at
Lochlie. The lease was quietly signed at Martinmas,
1783, it being apparent by that time that William
Burnes had not many weeks to live. Secrecy was
necessary; the Court of Session had not yet rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
its decision, and their action, if it became known,
might be unfavourably construed. Whatever small
savings had not gone for legal expenses were invested
in the new enterprise, and Hamilton pointed
out a loop-hole through which the children might
salvage something after their father’s death. Robert
and Gilbert were already credited with the regular
wages of labourers. Let the other children also get
themselves ranked as employees on the farm. Then
they could enter claims for unpaid wages against
their father’s estate, thereby becoming preferred
creditors who must be paid in full before M’Lure
or his mortgagors got anything. The scheme worked.
Enough was saved from the wreck to enable the
family, shaken and desperately poor—when the
youngest boy, John, died in November, 1785, they
could not raise the few shillings to pay for the best
mortcloth at his funeral—to re-establish their household
at Mossgiel, intact except for its head.</p>

<p>The new head was Robert, and in the months that
followed his father’s death the full results of his
Irvine lessons showed for the first time. In the two
intervening years he had been too much oppressed
with labour and anxiety to have time or inclination
to show the new spirit in all its fullness, though he
had shown enough to disturb his father. Now he
was free, and the fruits of his freedom were varied
and not always edifying. The earnest young debater
of the Tarbolton Bachelors’ Club and the self-conscious
author of essay-letters gave place to Rab
Mossgiel. Burns became the focus for a group of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
reckless youngsters, most of them younger than
himself, who looked up to him much as he had
looked up to Richard Brown three years before.
Foremost in the group were John Richmond and
James Smith, both of them full of the animal high
spirits which so often disguise the basic commonplaceness
of young minds. Along with Burns they
set out to scandalize the orthodox, and succeeded.
By the end of 1785 Richmond and Smith, like Burns,
had mounted the cutty-stool for fornication, and
Richmond had fled from the turmoil to the comparative
sanctuary of an Edinburgh lawyer’s office.</p>

<p>These cronies are chiefly noteworthy as evidence
of Burns’s still uncritical mind. As with Bob Ainslie
later, there was really nothing to them except
youthful exuberance. Their laughter was the ready
chorus for Burns’s wit; his sparkle made them shine
with a reflected light to which they actually contributed
little. By comparison the poor poetaster,
Davie Sillar of the Tarbolton Bachelors, was almost
a genius. In his characterization of Tarbolton townsfolk
Sillar left behind him at least one quotable
phrase, which is more than any of the Mauchline
group did. They cannot be charged with leading
Burns astray—if any leading was needed Burns
supplied it—and their biographical importance is
negligible except as they gave him an outlet for confidences
which might not otherwise have been recorded.
When Burns went to Edinburgh he lodged
with Richmond during his first winter; during the
second winter Richmond was in Mauchline a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
part of the time. Burns’s last extant letters to him
reveal some details about Jean Armour and her
children, but lack the enthusiasm of the ones written
in 1786. Smith left Mauchline to engage in calico-printing
at Linlithgow. Failing there, he fled to the
West Indies and died obscurely, as Burns came so
near doing. Both friendships were spent and empty
before the correspondence closed. The contrast between
the mediocre abilities of the two men and the
quality of the poetry they evoked from Burns is
even more remarkable than the disparity between
the illiterate farm-lasses of Tarbolton and Mauchline
and the lyrics Burns addressed to them.</p>

<p>By the time he was twenty-six Burns’s status
among people of his own rank was firmly established.
He was the unquestioned leader of the reckless
young; the welcome companion of ribald and
unorthodox elders. The attitude toward him of the
staid and sober ranged from sad head-shaking to
violent denunciation. With people of rank above
his own, however, he was still uneasy. Hamilton
was probably the first man of the professional class
with whom he formed a genuine friendship. John
Mackenzie, the Mauchline surgeon who attended
William Burnes in his last illness, remembered that
on first visiting Lochlie he found Gilbert frank, modest,
well-informed, and communicative, the father
revealing the remains of an able mind beneath the
cloud of illness and distress, and the mother quiet,
sagacious, and self-possessed. But Burns sat glowering
in a dark corner, ‘distant, suspicious, and without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
any wish to interest or please’; scrutinizing
Mackenzie and obviously prepared to resent any
display of superiority or patronage. As the doctor
showed himself affable Burns gradually thawed.
Though the written records of the friendship are
meagre, Burns plainly liked and trusted Mackenzie,
and Mackenzie reciprocated. From the time of their
first meeting, the doctor declared, ‘I took a lively
interest in Robert Burns, and, before I was acquainted
with his poetical power, I perceived that he
possessed very great mental abilities, an uncommon,
fertile and lively imagination, a thorough acquaintance
with many of our Scottish poets, and an enthusiastic
admiration of Ramsay and Fergusson. I have
always thought that no person could have a just
idea of the extent of Burns’s talents who had not an
opportunity to hear him converse. His discrimination
of character was great beyond that of any person
I ever knew....’ The surgeon introduced
Burns as a poet to his own friend and patron, Sir
John Whitefoord, who had previously known of
the young farmer only as an earnest member of
St. James’s Lodge; he also gave an introduction to
Captain Andrew Erskine of Edinburgh, Boswell’s
friend, and claimed to have been the first to bring
the Kilmarnock <i>Poems</i> to the attention of Hugh
Blair. It was to Mackenzie and not to Gavin Hamilton
that Burns turned for very practical help in the
stormy weeks preceding his final acknowledgement
of his marriage to Jean Armour, and when Mackenzie
provided Jean and her lover with quarters in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
own house he must have faced a weight of criticism
from the embattled saints and gossips of the village
that would have daunted many a man with a professional
status to maintain.</p>

<p>The pride which Richard Brown had taught to
flow in proper channels was becoming all the more
touchy as Burns’s confidence in himself increased.
Sure of himself now among his equals, he was still
resentfully helpless when superiors rubbed in their
superiority. He had come as far as he could in his
merely social capacity; what carried him the rest
of the way was his poetry. Here Gavin Hamilton
more or less unwittingly took the lead in introducing
Burns to a new world. The Kirk Session of Mauchline,
seeking to re-establish the old-time rigours of
the Scottish Sabbath, had decided for once to make
an example of a prominent citizen instead of an
obscure one. Accordingly in the summer of 1784
Hamilton was summoned to stand trial for various
ecclesiastical crimes such as absenting himself from
church, habitually neglecting family worship, and
causing a servant to dig new potatoes on a Sunday.
On being convicted, Hamilton promptly appealed
his case to the Presbytery of Ayr, and ultimately
won it. How Burns intervened with ‘The Twa
Herds’ has already been told. His authorship of
that poem and its successors was soon avowed as
the manuscripts passed from hand to New Light
hand amid roars of Homeric laughter. People and
institutions accustomed to taking themselves and
being taken by others with the most intense seriousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
are helpless in the face of mirth. Burns had
found the one weapon which the orthodox could
not withstand, though they could, and did, revenge
themselves on the author of their humiliation. The
fury generated by his satires did as much as, or
more than, the odium of his personal sins to make
Mauchline so unbearable that by 1786 Burns was
ready to flee to Jamaica.</p>

<p>But if his satires made the village too hot for him
they were also the direct means of enabling him to
escape both from the village and from the ranks of
the peasantry. One of the first friends to whom
Hamilton showed ‘The Twa Herds’ was another
lawyer, Robert Aiken of Ayr, who conducted and
won Hamilton’s case before the Presbytery. Hamilton,
apart from the conviviality almost inseparable
from a man of his profession in eighteenth-century
Scotland, was cool and businesslike. Aiken
was emotional and enthusiastic, a good forensic
reader and speaker, and an easy prey to sentiment.
Pathos, in life or in a poem, suffused his eyes with
tears and set the buttons popping on his tight waistcoat.
But, like the more famous Man of Feeling,
Henry Mackenzie, Aiken seldom in daily life permitted
sentiment to overcloud common sense. Along
with his fellow townsman, John Ballantine the
banker, the lawyer soon became the poet’s confidant
and chief literary adviser. ‘Orator Bob’ lost no opportunity
of reading his young friend’s verses aloud,
with such expression that Burns later declared he
had never fully appreciated his own work until he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
heard Aiken read it. As the poet’s troubles thickened
in the early months of 1786 it was with Aiken and
Ballantine that he discussed both his plans for emigration
and his arrangements for publishing his
poems, their decision as to what ought to be included
in the Kilmarnock volume apparently being
final. Though Aiken’s action, as James Armour’s
legal adviser, in cancelling whatever ‘lines’ Burns
had given Jean, caused a momentary chill, the lawyer
soon proved that his professional conduct did
not interfere with his private friendships. He obtained
145 subscriptions for the Kilmarnock <i>Poems</i>—nearly
one-fourth of the entire edition. Even amid
the excitement of his first dazzling fame in Edinburgh
Burns recalled with a glow of affection the
kindly patronage of Aiken and Ballantine, and long
after he had quitted Ayrshire forever he continued
from time to time to send them new poems which
he thought they might like. As late as 1791 he was
still gratefully remembering Ballantine’s part in
handing him ‘up to the “Court of the Gentiles” in
the temple of Fame’—a figure of speech which combined
neatness and literal accuracy. It was only to
the outer court—that of the bourgeoisie and minor
gentry—that Aiken and Ballantine were able to
conduct him.</p>

<p>The association with Hamilton fared worse.
Poetry, except in the form of humour and satire,
did not, it would seem, appeal to Hamilton as it did
to Aiken, and between him and Burns was always
the barrier of their business relation as landlord and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
tenant. Ultimately, indeed, a matter of business estranged
them. In the spring of 1788, nearly two
years after Gilbert Burns had become the sole lessee
of Mossgiel, Hamilton apparently asked Burns to
become his brother’s surety. The poet, who was
lending Gilbert nearly half the proceeds of the Edinburgh
<i>Poems</i>, declined to commit himself any further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The language of refusal is to me the most difficult
language on earth, and you are the man of the world, excepting
One of R<sup>t</sup> Hon<sup>ble</sup> designation [i. e., Lord Glencairn],
to whom it gives me the greatest pain to hold such
language.... I never wrote a letter which gave me so
much pain in my life, as I know the unhappy consequences:
I shall incur the displeasure of a Gentleman for
whom I have the highest respect, and to whom I am
deeply oblidged.’</p>
</div>

<p>The foreboding was justified. After that reluctant
refusal, Burns’s relations with his former landlord
never regained their old cordiality.</p>

<p>In his contacts with Aiken, Ballantine, Hamilton,
and certain of the New Light clergy Burns had, by
the spring of 1786, taken a further step in the realization
of his own capacities. He found himself quite
at ease, at least in male company, among members
of the professional class to whom as a lad he had
looked up with awe. He was discovering, moreover,
that he was not their inferior in native ability.
Though he did not know it then, he had in fact
reached as high a level as he was ever to maintain
in Scottish society. These lesser gentry not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
received him, but treated him as an equal. The higher
gentry—people of estates and pedigrees—the higher
professional classes, and the nobility, might receive
him for a time, but always with a latent condescension.
Sooner or later, even with Mrs. Dunlop, even
with Robert Riddell, some incident would reveal
that their feeling toward him was after all <i>de haut en
bas</i>. The friends whom he kept among men of social
and professional standing, from Aiken and Ballantine
at the beginning of his career to Alexander
Findlater and John Syme at its close, were gentlemen,
were men of education, but they were not, in
Burns’s favourite capitalized phrase, Great People.</p>

<p>But in the summer and autumn of 1786 it seemed
there might be no limit to Burns’s social advancement.
As he went about the country during August
and September, collecting the subscriptions for his
poems, the parish outcast of a few months earlier
found himself everywhere courted and applauded.
New acquaintances and old united to draw him out,
and the bolder his remarks the better they liked
them. But he was still capable of awe. In October
came an invitation to dine on the 23rd at Catrine
House, country home of Dugald Stewart, Professor
of Moral Philosophy in Edinburgh University. The
company included Basil William, Lord Daer, the
flighty and consumptive but liberal-minded son and
heir of the Earl of Selkirk. In an amusing set of
verses Burns described how, at the prospect of meeting
a peer for the first time, his knees shook as he
sidled into the Professor’s drawing-room, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
reverted to his old trick of watching from a corner
until he had taken the measure of the company.
The incident is worth mentioning because it was
probably the last time Burns was ever unsure of
himself in society. In later months and years he was
often irritated and uncomfortable when members
of the upper classes emphasized their elevation, but
such feelings were the reverse of awe. Two months
after the dinner at Catrine he was meeting professors
and peers by the dozen instead of the brace, and was
maintaining not merely self-possession but critical
appraisal.</p>

<p>Burns’s standards of social intercourse, as of so
many other things, were firmly established before
the surviving records become full enough for detailed
study. They were as honest and straight-forward
as the rest of his dealings. Except for the
brief embarrassment of a first meeting, rank as such
meant nothing to him. What he demanded, and all
he demanded, of any man was, in his own phrase,
that he have something to him. That something
must be native; a matter of mind and personality,
not of social place. A Souter Johnie was better company
than a Hugh Blair, because the cobbler’s wit
and wisdom were the product of native shrewdness
dealing with first-hand experience; the professor’s
attainments were ‘meerly an astonishing proof what
industry and application can do’. To his cultured
friends, Burns seemed to have a perverse taste for
low company, whereas his real quest was genuine
company. His own unbridled wit and tempestuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
emotions naturally made him gravitate towards
other similarly endowed people, who too often were
not pillars of society, but this was not his reason for
choosing them. When a pillar of society bore himself
‘to all the Actors, high and low, in the drama of Life,
simply as they merited in playing their parts’, and
excelled in telling a story—in other words, when
the pillar was Dugald Stewart—Burns enjoyed his
company as much as John Rankine’s or Willie
Nicol’s. Nor was wit or waggishness necessarily demanded.
Grave wisdom Burns could relish as well
as gay, though not in every mood; what he could
never endure was dullness, pomposity, or conceit.</p>

<p>As the autumn of 1786 wore on, new friends and
old agreed that the success of the Kilmarnock <i>Poems</i>
should make Burns abandon his flight to Jamaica.
He ought to publish a second edition in Edinburgh
and then settle down, either on a farm of his own,
or—as Aiken suggested—in the Excise service. The
poet would find plenty of friends to help him win a
hearing, and publishing in the capital would give
him a national instead of a local audience. Burns
must have made up his mind immediately after his
dinner with Dugald Stewart. Among his new friends
was Alexander Dalziel, steward of the Renfrewshire
estates of the Earl of Glencairn. On November 1
Dalziel wrote to congratulate Burns on abandoning
the West Indian venture and to tell him that he had
showed the <i>Poems</i> to the Earl himself. The Earl
bought a copy, which he had richly bound, and expressed
warm interest in the poems and their author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>Thus began Burns’s most successful acquaintance
with a peer—the only association of the sort which
did not sooner or later end in apathy on one side
and humiliation on the other. Though the circumstances
of Burns’s earliest introduction to Edinburgh
society are obscure, the obscurity is lightened if we
take at face value the poet’s repeated statements
that he owed everything to Glencairn—that the
Earl, as he put it, took him by the hand and led
him up to fame. Burns afterwards said that he went
to the city without letters of introduction, but that
can have been true only in the narrowest sense.
Dalziel certainly apprised Glencairn of Burns’s
plans, as Dr. Mackenzie apprised Sir John Whitefoord
and Andrew Erskine, and as the Rev. George
Lawrie of Loudoun apprised the blind poet, Thomas
Blacklock. Dugald Stewart also must have known
of the decision. Within a week of his arrival, Burns
was the lion of the Edinburgh season. Many new
friends must have contributed to such immediate
success, but the poet’s emphasis on Glencairn’s kindness
marks the Earl as the man who secured the
patronage of the fashionable Caledonian Hunt, and
probably also as his sponsor in Masonic society.</p>

<p>All this the Earl succeeded in doing without offending
the touchy poet by condescension, though
Burns’s pride sometimes suffered because of Glencairn’s
deference to people of superior rank. Once,
indeed, Burns was ‘within half a point’ of throwing
down his ‘gage of contemptuous defiance’ because
the Earl was giving too much attention to a wealthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
dunderpate, but even then he was quickly reassured
as to Glencairn’s sincere good wishes. Touchiness
aside, Burns’s position in Edinburgh recalls Benjamin
Franklin’s at Versailles a decade before. In
each place the fashionable world thought it had discovered
a child of nature; in each place the newcomer
had really a shrewder mind and a quicker
penetration of character and motive than most of
the <i>élite</i> who patronized him. The contrast between
Burns’s attitude toward Glencairn and toward his
fellow peer, the Earl of Buchan, shows how thoroughly
the poet had learned to take men’s measure regardless
of rank. Buchan also had professed great
interest in Burns and was lavish with advice, but
Burns recognized the man as an egotistical windbag
and received his advice with an elaborate irony of
compliment which would have betrayed itself to
anyone less conceited than the busybody who once,
when Sir Walter Scott lay ill, volunteered to arrange
his funeral, and who, when he himself had written
some amazingly bad verses, accepted as a tribute
John Taylor’s publication of them in a part of <i>The
Scots Magazine</i> ‘distinct from the mass of vulgar
poetry’.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Burns’s deference to Glencairn had
unfortunate results. In securing William Creech, his
brother’s former tutor, as Burns’s publisher, Glencairn
thought he was doing the best possible good
turn. Yet the outcome was months of vexation and
delay for the poet, and the loss of all profits from
later editions of his poems. Moreover, the poet had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
soberly decided that his best hope for a livelihood
lay in securing an Excise post which would support
him while he banked his profits as a reserve fund for
his children. But Glencairn, like Mrs. Dunlop and
other gentry whose knowledge of the lives of tenant
farmers was limited to the quarterly receipt of their
rents, was all for the poet’s investing his capital in a
farm of his own. Disapproving of the Excise scheme,
Glencairn would do nothing to forward it, though a
word from him in the right place—that is, in the
ears of Henry Dundas—would have procured Burns
the appointment he sought. As it was, all hints fell
dead, while meantime Patrick Miller dangled the
bait of Ellisland. When at last Burns interested a
man willing to help the Excise plan, the mischief
was already done; he was committed to the undertaking
which swallowed all his little capital. The
best intentions of his would-be patrons kept turning
to evil for Burns; even Glencairn’s gift of a diamond-pointed
pencil made trouble by supplying the poet
with the means of inscribing blazing indiscretions
on window-panes.</p>

<p>Burns observed the rest of the Edinburgh gentry
and literati as closely as he did Glencairn and Buchan.
He was measuring himself and his native ability
against them, and was not inclined to award
himself second place. But he was not comfortable
with most of them. Even if they did not offend him
by overt condescension he was fully aware that they
received him only because he was the fad of the moment.
When the novelty staled he could not hope to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
continue many friendships in exalted quarters. The
tide of popularity had swept him higher than he
could expect to remain; its ebb might leave him
stranded far lower than he deserved. It was not
long, indeed, before his hosts began to find things to
criticize. Burns not only said what he thought, he
said it with an emphasis they found unbecoming in
a man of peasant birth. The great Doctor Johnson
could be as gruff as he pleased with his Scottish hosts
because he was Johnson; Lord Braxfield could roar
and Lord Kames rave, both bawdy, in a gentleman’s
home because they were Lords of Session; for
Burns to express emphatic opinions argued a lack of
the humility which beseemed a ploughman entertained
by his betters.</p>

<p>The fact was that Burns lacked both the finesse
which would have enabled him neatly and inoffensively
to deal with snubs, and the insensitive egotism
which could have ignored them. No one could
snub the Ettrick Shepherd, because his magnificent
self-esteem made it impossible for him to see any remark
in anything but a complimentary light. One
did not safely snub Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, because
that wasp could sting. Burns’s pride, unfortunately,
not only made him sensitive; it made him
aggressive and heavy-handed. When he flaunted the
blue-and-buff of the Whigs he was going out of his
way to assert his independence among people who
were mostly Tories; when he told a lady, who had
not waited an introduction before inviting him to
her party, that he would come if she would also invite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the learned pig from the Grassmarket, he was
making a show of himself in one way in the very
act of resenting being made a show in another. The
consciousness that he was acting a part—whether
behaving like a country bumpkin in Smellie’s printing-house,
or posing as the Bard of Nature in drawing-rooms—no
doubt partly explains some of his
more violent outbursts. Thus when he demolished a
clergyman, whose niggling criticisms of Gray had
goaded him beyond endurance, with the Johnsonian
thunderbolt, ‘Sir, I now perceive a man may be
an excellent judge of poetry by square and rule, and
after all be a damned blockhead!’ the victim was
probably drawing all the electric tension which had
been accumulating in the poet’s nerves through a
long series of irritations and repressions. But such
things did him no good in Edinburgh society.</p>

<p>It was not that his manners were worse than gentlemen’s.
In some respects they were probably better.
‘Swearing,’ Henry Cockburn dryly records,
‘was thought the right, and the mark, of a gentleman.
And, tried by this test, nobody, who had not
seen them, could now be made to believe how many
gentlemen there were.’ Boswell’s long-suffering wife,
Margaret Montgomerie, took her husband to task
for his loud and abusive manner of asserting himself
in argument, and Boswell admitted to his journal
that she was right. Benjamin Franklin remarked
that Edinburgh was the only place he knew where
violent disputatiousness was not confined to lawyers
and university men. But when a mere peasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
exhibited, in however mild a form, the traits of the
gentry, he was forgetting his place, and should be
put back in it.</p>

<p>Moreover, Burns quickly realized that these gentry
scorned the national tradition which was his
life-blood. If they did not all, like Dr. John Moore,
urge him henceforth to write in standard English,
they at least made it plain that a Scots poet could
not aspire to literary equality with Dr. Beattie and
Dr. Blair. Robert Fergusson was a regrettable scamp
whom Edinburgh preferred to forget; Burns erected,
at his own expense, a monument to Fergusson, and
insisted, in speech and writing, on praising the dead
poet and heaping scorn on the gentry who had let
him starve. The place where Burns, after the first
few weeks, really enjoyed himself in Edinburgh and
where he made most of his intimate and lasting
friendships, was among the Crochallan Fencibles.
This was one of the numerous clubs in which lawyers
and merchants carried on the old convivial
traditions of their city. Edinburgh clubs were ancient
institutions which arrayed bibulous functions
in ceremonials ranging from the harmless High
Jinks described by Scott in <i>Guy Mannering</i> to almost
psychopathic debauchery in such an organization
as the Wig Club. They were, in fact, along with the
Freemasons, the ancestors both of the American
fraternal orders and of the Rotary and Kiwanis
Clubs. In the more elaborately organized groups
each officer, and sometimes every member, had a
special title. Thus each member in Allan Ramsay’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
Easy Club took the name of an old Scottish writer;
in the Cape Club, to which Robert Fergusson belonged,
each member was a Knight Companion of
the Cape, with tides like Sir Cape, Sir Brimstone,
Sir Precenter (Fergusson himself), Sir Nun and Abbess,
and Sir Pope. The Fencibles went in for military
designations. William Smellie, the gruff, slovenly,
and erudite printer who was handling the
Edinburgh edition of the <i>Poems</i>, as Adjutant of the
corps introduced the poet. Burns’s publisher,
Creech, proved a social disappointment as well as a
financial disaster; his printer was a man after his
own heart, an ‘old Veteran in Genius, Wit and
Bawdry’. Smellie, like Burns, concealed an inward
diffidence and sensitivity beneath an aggressive
manner; like Burns, too, he was self-educated. The
poet was not far wrong in describing him as ‘a man
positively of the first abilities and greatest strength
of mind, as well as one of the best hearts and keenest
wits that I have met with.’ He had displayed his intellectual
power in his <i>Philosophy of Natural History</i>,
long regarded as a standard work, and in writing
large sections of the original <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>;
his wit he reserved for conversation, where, like
Burns’s, it allowed no considerations of reverence or
prudery to stand in its way. Despite his rough exterior,
he was able to captivate an intelligent woman
of the world like Maria Riddell, as well as the ebullient
poet. But the records of this friendship were too
much for Smellie’s squeamish executors; his biographer
piously relates that ‘many letters of Burns to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Mr. Smellie which remained, being totally unfit for
publication, and several of them containing severe
reflections on many respectable people still in life,
have been burnt.’</p>

<p>The records of another friendship which had its
start among the Edinburgh bookmen fared better.
Peter Hill, five years the poet’s senior, was in 1787
a clerk in Creech’s shop, but was soon to set up in
business for himself and prove a kindly and indulgent
master to an apprentice named Archibald Constable.
Hill’s was one of the few friendships Burns
made in Edinburgh which suffered no abatement
with time. From the summer of 1787, when Hill was
handling some of the innumerable details of business
relating to the Edinburgh <i>Poems</i>, until the beginning
of 1796, when Burns sent his ‘annual’ gift
of a kippered salmon from the Nith, their association
was unclouded. Hill supplied the poet with
books, sent presents to his family, and took care of
miscellaneous business errands in the city. Burns secured
for Hill the book-orders, first of the Monkland
Friendly Society and later of the Dumfries Public
Library, and interspersed his business communications
with hearty blasts of execration, broad humour,
and messages to all their common friends. Though
the phraseology of the letters often seems stilted, behind
its stiffness glows a genuine affection and esteem.</p>

<p>But the backbone of the Fencibles was the lawyers.
Their Colonel, William Dunbar, was a jolly
little bachelor some years older than the poet; their
Major and Muster-Master General was Charles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Hay, friend of Boswell in the days when the latter
was striving for distinction at the Scottish bar, whose
port-inflamed countenance blinks above his judicial
robes as Lord Newton in Raeburn’s superb portrait
in the Scottish National Gallery. More notable for
‘law, paunch, whist, claret, and worth’ than for literary
interests, Hay’s one poetic suggestion to Burns
had humiliating results. He was among those who
urged the poet to compose the unfortunate elegy
‘On the Death of Lord President Dundas’, the complete
ignoring of which by Dundas’s son inflicted on
Burns’s pride a wound which never healed.</p>

<p>Among the lawyer Fencibles the most congenial
to Burns was Alexander Cunningham, a distant and
impoverished relative of Lord Glencairn. Though
Burns described him to his face as dissipated but not
debauched—a subtle distinction of which the exact
import is probably forever lost—Cunningham was
diffident and retiring. Perhaps for this reason, perhaps
also because of his kinship to Glencairn, Burns
never sent him on such ticklish errands as he entrusted
to Bob Ainslie, but their literary and intellectual
fellowship was sincere. Unlike Hay and
Ainslie, Cunningham had real fondness for the higher
types of poetry, though to offset this he had the anglicized
Scotsman’s inability to see anything but the
ludicrous and the low in folk literature. Burns felt
that in offering ‘My Love is like a red red rose’ to
Cunningham he had to apologize for its simplicity;
Popean imitations would have been more in his line.
The young lawyer, in short, belonged to the generation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
which was trying to live down the national
characteristics that meant most to Burns. In Edinburgh
the legal profession was the last stronghold of
the rich old gusto of Scottish life, the last group of
men unashamed of being ‘characters’. But even
there such traits belonged mainly to the generation
passing or past which included men like Braxfield,
Monboddo, and Kames, or to the already mature
generation of Charles Hay and Henry Erskine. Cunningham
belonged more nearly to the generation of
Henry Cockburn, without Cockburn’s relish for the
memories of traits which he did not share.</p>

<p>Within the limits imposed by his diffidence and
his tastes, Cunningham had no reason to complain
of lack of sympathy or confidence from Burns. When
his first sweetheart jilted him with humiliating publicity,
Cunningham told his sorrow to Burns, who
had previously supplied him with a poor song in
furtherance of his suit, and who now condoled in
terms which bore hard on the young lady. The
poet’s letters ranged from gay impromptu verses to
the confession that as a result of the fiasco of the
elegy, ‘I never see the name, Dundas, in the column
of a newspaper, but my heart seems straitened
for room in my bosom; &amp; if I am obliged to read
aloud a paragraph relating to one of them, I feel my
forehead flush, &amp; my nether lip quivers.’ On his
part, Cunningham obtained for Burns the last national
honour which Edinburgh conferred in his
lifetime—election to membership in the socially exclusive
Royal Company of Archers. And at the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Cunningham received one of the poet’s desperate
appeals for help—not for money, but for intercession
with the Commissioners of Excise not to put
him on half-pay during his illness. Cunningham,
moreover, shared with John Syme the credit for setting
on foot the subscription for Jean and the children
after Burns’s death, though his diffidence made
him a poor collector of funds. Through diffidence,
also, he permitted George Thomson to prepare for
the newspapers the obituary he should have written
himself, and by this neglect did injury to his friend’s
memory.</p>

<p>But the names of three other friends are associated
with much more damage to Burns’s reputation during
his life and after his death. Only one of the three
was a Fencible—Robert Cleghorn, a jolly gentleman
farmer from Corstorphine. Cleghorn had what Cunningham
lacked, a strong relish for vernacular literature,
publishable or unpublishable. Thus he became
the recipient of many choice bits of verse,
sometimes traditional and sometimes original, for
his own and his friends’ edification. The correspondence
harmed Burns’s reputation not through its publication
but through its long suppression. That remarkable
moralist, Lord Byron, read the Cleghorn
letters in manuscript and set down in his journal a
highly-coloured summary of them as ‘full of oaths
and obscene songs’ which stimulated the imaginations
of several generations of readers. Now that the
surviving letters can be read in full, they produce no
such revulsion as do some of the things Burns wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
about Jean Armour and Maria Riddell. For readers
who do not relish broad humour they may be distasteful,
but beneath their coarseness is the record
of a genuine friendship with an honest, hearty, and
generous man. One suspects that had Cunningham,
for instance, visited Burns at Ellisland or Dumfries,
he would have felt the same disillusionment at sight
of the poet’s narrow and primitive domestic life
which the pettier Robert Ainslie recorded. Cleghorn
made such a visit in 1795, when Burns’s health
and spirits were already declining, and left behind
him a warm glow of renewed and strengthened
friendship.</p>

<p>It is regrettable that Cleghorn’s name should be,
for most readers of Burns, associated with the poet’s
collection of ‘cloaciniad’ verse. In fact, Cleghorn received
no more of such work than did a dozen other
friends, but John Allen, his stepson and heir, had
ideas about the treatment of a great poet’s manuscripts
which differed from those of William Smellie’s
executors. Allen did not feel free, by mutilating
some of his most characteristic letters, to ‘protect
the memory’ of a poet who had never tried to disguise
any side of his own nature. And Cleghorn’s
tastes were as catholic as David Herd’s, or as Burns’s
own. He measured the merit of a song by its singing
quality, and not by its suitability for use in a young
ladies’ seminary. Burns sent him the charming ‘O
wat ye wha that lo’es me’ with the certainty that it
would please him as much as the broadest ribaldry.
The male who in male company does not occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
relish crude humour is a scarce creature in any
age or nation; was perhaps unusually scarce in
eighteenth-century Scotland. The songs which went
to Cleghorn went also to Graham of Fintry and
Provost Maxwell, to Collector Mitchell and John
M’Murdo and John Syme—in other words, to some
of the best and most loyal characters in Burns’s circle.
Boswell’s journals are crammed with proof that
similar tastes prevailed in still higher ranks of
society.</p>

<p>To avoid misunderstanding both Burns and his
friends, a brief digression is necessary regarding the
book entitled <i>The Merry Muses of Caledonia</i>. Burns
was well aware that his own work, like the folk-songs
he collected, was divided into the publishable
and the unpublishable. But he did not draw the line
where his later editors did. To him, ‘The Jolly Beggars’,
‘A Poet’s Welcome’, and ‘Holy Willie’ were
no fitter for general circulation than were ‘When
Princes and Prelates’ and ‘The Court of Equity’.
They were <i>jeux d’esprit</i> intended for private circulation
among a few intimates. His riotous imagination
respected no boundaries when it began to play;
what distinguishes most of his bawdry from the
common sort is its wit. And this wit as frequently
saw how an improper folk-song could be made
more brilliantly improper as it saw how a halting
one could be made lyric. Much of his folk collection,
together with ‘a very few’ of his own composition,
was written into a manuscript volume which he
sometimes lent about, with strict injunctions as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
secrecy. According to tradition, that volume fell
after his death into unscrupulous hands and formed
the basis of the earliest of the various collections
called <i>The Merry Muses</i>. The tradition is almost
certainly wrong. The ultimate source may have been
Burns, but not the immediate one. In all the editions
the authentic Burns verses are too garbled to
have been printed from his own copies. They bear
every sign of oral transmission or hasty transcription
at several removes from the original. The real manuscript
was probably destroyed after Burns’s death;
certainly it was never printed. It would have been
better for his reputation if it had, for he now stands
father or godfather to a garbled mass of Scottish,
English, and Irish filth, little of which he wrote, and
some of which he never even saw.</p>

<p>Neither Robert Ainslie nor William Nicol needed
the chance association of their names with fescennine
verse to bring discredit on Burns. Their own
conduct sufficed. Ainslie, like Cunningham, was a
young lawyer, but the two moved in different orbits,
and were never brought together even by their
friendship for Burns. They appealed to different
facets of the poet’s nature, Ainslie’s relation to him
being that of Smith and Richmond in the days of
the Fornicators’ Court. The son of a good family in
the Border village of Dunse, Ainslie was celebrating
his recent emancipation from parental government
by sowing a plentiful crop of wild oats. Full of the
high spirits of twenty-one, he furnished the same
ready chorus of laughter the Mauchline cronies had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
provided, and was rapidly qualifying himself to discuss
with Burns the pleasing topic of comparative
bastardy. The most enjoyable part of the poet’s
Border tour in May, 1787, was his visit to Dunse;
after Ainslie left him he complained that he never
had a mouthful of really hearty laughter on the trip.</p>

<p>Even the mutilated letters which survive show
that Burns freely confided his past and present peccadillos
to Ainslie; the sequel proves the confidence
to have been ill bestowed. At the end of the Border
tour, for instance, Burns found awaiting him in
Dumfries post-office a letter from Meg Cameron, an
Edinburgh servant girl who was to bear a child
which she claimed was his. Ainslie was commissioned
to ‘send for the wench and give her ten or
twelve shillings’ against the poet’s return to the city.
In reply, Ainslie broke the news that he had himself
just become the father of an illegitimate son, and received
from his friend a roaring welcome to ‘the venerable
Society of Fathers’. Again in the following
year Burns favored Ainslie with a highly-coloured
account of his final reconciliation with Jean Armour,
and early in 1789 instructed his young friend to locate
Jenny Clow so that Burns, on his arrival in
Edinburgh, could settle the suit Jenny had brought
against him. More creditable matters also occupied
the correspondence. Some of Burns’s earliest doubts
about Ellisland, some of his deepest gloom about his
own and his family’s future, were told to Ainslie.
But the friendship died before Burns did, and
through Ainslie’s fault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>On Friday, October 15, 1790, Ainslie came to
Ellisland for the week-end. On Monday he reported
the visit to Agnes M’Lehose, with whom he was by
this time on confidential, and even flirtatious,
terms. The warmth of Burns’s welcome was gratifying,
but the house, he noted, was ‘ill contrived—and
pretty Dirty, and <i>Hugry Mugry</i>’, and its other
inmates pleased him little. Jean was ‘Vulgar &amp;
Common-place in a considerable degree—and
pretty round &amp; fat’, but ‘a kind Body in her Own
way, and the husband Tolerably Attentive to her’.
Also present were Burns’s sister and sister-in-law—‘common
looking girls’—and ‘3 Male and female
cousins’ who had been helping with the harvest.</p>

<p>Burns rejoiced that his friend had arrived ‘upon
his <i>Kirn</i> night, when he Expected some of his friends
to help make merry’, but sight of the guests deepened
Ainslie’s depression, for they were ‘a Vulgar
looking Tavern keeper from Dumfries; and his Wife
more Vulgar—Mr. Miller of Dalswinton’s Gardener
and his Wife—and said Wife’s sister—and a
little fellow from Dumfries, who had been a Clerk’.
Burns and the rest had a good time, ‘Dancing, and
Kissing the Lasses at the End of every dance’, while
Ainslie shuddered to the depths of his paltry little
soul. Burns the peasant was enjoying himself in the
world of his birth, and the young snob from Edinburgh
couldn’t understand him at all:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘... Our Friend himself is as ingenious as ever, and
Seems very happy with the Situation I have described—His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Mind however now appears to me to be a great Mixture
of the poet and the Excise Man—One day he sits
down and Writes a Beautiful poem—and the Next he
Seizes a cargo of Tobacco from some unfortunate Smuggler—or
Roups out some poor Wretch for Selling liquors
without a License. From his conversation he Seems to be
frequently among the Great—but No Attention is paid
by people of any rank to his wife....’</p>
</div>

<p>After such a letter—withheld from complete publication
until 1938—it is plain enough why the
friendship went into a swift decline. For another
year or two Burns continued to write, gaily or confidentially,
but got small response. Ainslie’s last letter,
early in 1794, ‘was so dry, so distant, so like a
card to one of his clients’, that the poet ‘could
scarce bear to read it’, and never answered it. The
lawyer was already on his way, via the fashionable
<i>Werther</i> melancholy, back to the orthodox piety
which led him, early in the nineteenth century, to
compose a couple of devotional pamphlets. But
neither piety nor loyalty sufficed to make him protect
the memory of the friend whose name has kept
his alive. Preserving the reckless letters Burns had
written him, he allowed them to pass into circulation,
once at least accompanied by a formal docket
certifying that Burns was the author of a letter
signed with a humorous pen-name. The mutilations
which so many of the manuscripts have suffered
were the work of later owners.</p>

<p>Ainslie’s chief injury to Burns’s fame was inflicted
after the poet’s death; William Nicol, Latin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
master in Edinburgh High School, harmed him in
life. A coarse, egotistical, drunken man of violent
temper, Nicol was also one of the foremost Latin
scholars of his day. In his bawdy violence of language
Burns saw wit; his emphatic dislike of his
superiors Burns interpreted as proof of an independent
spirit. No great harm might have come of
the friendship had it been confined to drinking
bouts in Edinburgh and to correspondence thereafter.
Unfortunately Burns took Nicol as his travelling
companion on the tour of the Highlands in
September, 1787. This tour was Burns’s chance to
meet influential folk in their homes and to show
himself at his best. Thanks to Nicol he came near to
showing himself at his worst. Among the people
from whom he had invitations were the Duke and
Duchess of Athole. Their reception of him at Blair
Athole was all the touchy poet could desire. The
Duke and Duchess were cordiality itself; among the
guests was Robert Graham of Fintry, Commissioner
of Excise, whose friendship and influence could be
of the utmost importance to Burns; a still more influential
person, Henry Dundas, dispenser of patronage
for all Scotland, was expected next day on one
of his periodical inspections of his political fences.
Everything seemed to be going well for Burns when
Nicol, the ‘most unprincipled savage’, intervened.
The boorish schoolmaster, finding himself neglected
in favour of his companion, decided to move on at
once, and insisted on Burns’s going with him. The
poet’s pride made him guilty of outrageous bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
manners. In reply to Nicol’s insistence, Burns should
have bidden him go to the devil his own gait. But
that might have been interpreted as subservience to
the Great. Through what can only be described as
inverted snobbery, Burns allowed Nicol to drag him
away. The scene was repeated at Castle Gordon,
where the merry Duchess, who had declared in
Edinburgh that Burns swept her off her feet, pleaded
in vain against Nicol’s urgings. Though he afterwards
wrote complimentary and apologetic letters,
and cursed the ‘obstinate son of Latin Prose’, Burns
could not efface the impression he had made. He
never saw the Atholes or the Gordons again.</p>

<p>Throughout the trip Nicol’s conduct was the
same; he even snatched Burns away before breakfast
from the home of his cousin, James Burness of Montrose.
The Highland tour, though he did not then
realize it, was Burns’s last opportunity to enlist the
active friendship of people whose influence might
have changed his life. His failure was largely Nicol’s
fault. Reports of his abrupt and ungracious conduct
undoubtedly came back to Edinburgh and contributed
to the comparative neglect he suffered during
his second winter in the city. Edinburgh was too
small a place for misconduct to hide in; every lawyer
in the old Parliament House would have heard
that a servant girl had brought suit against the Ayrshire
Bard; the stories from the Highlands, losing
nothing in the telling, would add to the swelling
tide of hostile gossip. The talk, indeed, reached so
far, and was believed so implicitly, that not even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
death could alter Edinburgh opinion. Cunningham’s
efforts to interest prominent citizens in the
subscription for Burns’s widow and children met repeated
snubs and refusals; to this day, despite the
monument on the Calton Hill, the city pays only a
half-hearted tribute to his memory.</p>

<p>Of course all blame for the hostile talk cannot be
shifted to Nicol, or even to Meg Cameron and Jenny
Clow. Burns was indiscreet enough to start plenty of
tales without help. But his too long stay unfortunately
predisposed many people to believe the worst
not only of his conduct in the city but afterwards.
Henry Mackenzie and Dugald Stewart, for instance,
both accepted at face value the second-hand reports
of Burns’s alleged misdoings in Dumfries, and wrote
him off their books. For years anecdotes showing
Burns in an absurd or discreditable light circulated
in Edinburgh. Some may have been true; others
were malicious distortions which point the direction
taken by city opinion. Thus Lockhart told how
Hugh Blair had suggested, when a party of gentlemen
were discussing possible changes in the Kilmarnock
<i>Poems</i>, that ‘tidings of salvation’ might advantageously
be emended to ‘tidings of damnation’.
Thereupon the poet, according to Lockhart, embarrassed
the professor by asking permission to acknowledge
his improvement in a footnote. The basis
of the story is truth; its details are not. Blair did
suggest the change; Burns did, in conversation with
other people, acknowledge his help. But Blair’s suggestion
came in writing, as a carefully veiled hint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
amid other criticisms of the poems. The episode as
Lockhart told it is city gossip intended to display
Blair as the urbane professor and patron and Burns
as a clumsy rustic. Of no importance in itself, the
story is symptomatic of the attitude of cultured
Edinburgh after the first enthusiasm over Burns had
waned.</p>

<p>But no realization of the trouble Nicol was helping
to make, no recognition of the schoolmaster’s
real character, affected Burns. He continued, after
he left the city, to correspond with Nicol; when the
obstinate son of Latin Prose got into the row which
finally led to his resignation from the High School,
Burns championed him against his amiable principal,
Dr. Alexander Adam. By christening one of his
sons William Nicol, Burns proclaimed his friendship
to the world at large, and during the years at Ellisland
performed such services as getting appraisals
of a farm Nicol was buying, and maintaining a
broken-down mare which a horse-coper had passed
off on the schoolmaster. The friendship lasted until
February, 1793, when Burns was suffering from the
rage and humiliation which followed the official inquiry
into his revolutionary sympathies. Some report
of the matter having reached Nicol, he undertook
to rebuke Burns in a would-be facetious vein.
The poet was in no mood for rebuke or good advice,
facetious or not, and with his heavily satirical reply
to Nicol their correspondence ended—too late.</p>

<p>In any case Edinburgh friendships, good or bad,
however much he might try to maintain them by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
correspondence, could not supply companionship
when Burns moved to Ellisland. Though on his first
visit to Dumfries he had professed himself enchanted
with the company he met, he was lonely enough
when he actually settled there. He made acquaintances,
no doubt ‘men of talent and humour’, among
the tradesfolk and professional men of the town, but
people like Dr. James Mundell, Walter Auld the
saddler, Henry Clint of the King’s Arms, William
Hyslop of the Globe Inn, and Thomas Boyd, the
contractor who built Ellisland, are names and little
more. Apart from his landlord, Patrick Miller, with
whom his relations were soon strained, the most congenial
friend he had during the three years on the
farm was Robert Riddell of Glenriddell, whose estate
of Friars Carse marched with Ellisland.</p>

<p>Riddell was a country gentleman turned amateur
antiquarian. He had embellished his grounds with a
‘Druid Circle’ and a ‘Hermitage’; he dabbled in
numismatics and church architecture. These would
scarcely have interested Burns—though he remained
in the hermitage long enough to inscribe some verses
on the window with Glencairn’s diamond-pointed
pencil—but Riddell was also a musician in a small
way. Besides composing a few commonplace airs of
his own he professed great interest in the traditional
music of his country. Here Burns shared his enthusiasm
and far excelled his knowledge. The laird, perhaps
at Burns’s suggestion, subscribed for Johnson’s
<i>Museum</i> and had his set bound with blank interleaves
for notes on the songs, their authors, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
history. The number of his annotations gives the
measure of his knowledge. Out of four hundred
songs, one hundred and seventy have notes. Of
these, one hundred and fifty-two were written by
Burns, who must have spent many evenings at the
task in his friend’s library; eighteen were by Riddell
himself or an amanuensis. Sir Walter Scott summed
up the laird’s prose writings as ‘truly the most
extravagant compositions that ever a poor Man
abandoned by providence to the imaginations of his
own heart had the misfortune to devise.’</p>

<p>The company which sometimes came to Carse,
including as it did men like Joseph Farington the
painter—who noted that ‘Mr. Burns the Scottish
Poet’ was ‘a middle-sized man, ... black complexioned,
and his general appearance that of a
tradesman or mechanick’, had ‘a strong expressive
manner of delivering himself in conversation’, and
knew no Latin—and Francis Grose, the antiquary
whose inspiring enthusiasm was the real source of
‘Tam o’ Shanter’, was more important than Riddell
himself. The laird’s real tastes and aptitudes were
convivial. A man of powerful physique and a rather
overwhelming robustiousness of manner—William
Smellie spoke of ‘his immense fist and stentorian
voice’—he succeeded, like so many gentlemen of his
day, in wrecking his health at an early age. The
notorious ‘Whistle’ contest, in which Riddell and
his kinsmen Sir Robert Laurie and Alexander Fergusson
of Craigdarroch undertook to drink each
other under the table for the possession of a family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
heirloom, was probably more typical of the laird’s
true aptitudes than the annotations were. Even at
that, though, he was outdone by Craigdarroch, who
won the whistle by drinking ‘upds. of 5 Bottles of
Claret’. Burns, like most of the friends of the contestants,
found the incident vastly amusing; Burns’s
biographers have argued the question of his real
presence at Friars Carse with an almost theological
fervour; nevertheless its only interest or value for
posterity lies in the light it sheds on Robert Riddell’s
character. According to biographical tradition,
Robert Riddell was the staid member of the family
and his brother Walter the wild one; actually such
distinction between them seems as baseless as the
kindred legend that Gilbert Burns was a better
farmer than his brother. But whether Glenriddell
led or followed in the events which for a time
estranged the poet from the whole Riddell family,
the circumstances of the breach resemble with painful
clarity many other episodes in Burns’s contacts
with the gentry.</p>

<p>The full story of the ‘Rape of the Sabines’ is Maria
Riddell’s more than her brother-in-law’s, but Robert
Riddell had a share in the trouble. During 1792
and 1793, when Walter Riddell and his wife Maria
were occupying the estate of Goldielea or Woodley
Park, family relations were not always harmonious.
At a guess, Walter wanted to borrow from his elder
brother the funds to complete payment for Woodley
Park; at a guess, the wives failed to charm each
other. Whatever the causes, by the autumn of 1792<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
Burns had to assure Maria that he would listen to no
stories about her from Glenriddell—and presumably
also from Glenriddell’s wife. Yet for another year or
more the poet managed to stay on good terms with
both families. The year 1793 was, poetically and
flirtatiously, the highest point of Burns’s friendship
with Maria; the same year produced asseverations
of friendship as ‘ardent &amp; grateful’ on Burns’s part
as Robert Riddell’s was ‘kind and generous’. In
leisure moments the poet was transcribing a collection
of his letters as a companion volume to the collection
of unpublished verse he had given the laird
in 1791. On Christmas day he was still transcribing.
On January 12, 1794, his quarrel with Maria had
reached its climax. Somewhere between those two
dates had occurred the mysterious brawl in which
Robert Riddell’s part is still a matter of controversy.</p>

<p>If Robert Riddell was the host, who, by compelling
Burns to drink more than he wished to, reduced
the poet to a state in which he insulted his hostess,
the laird’s conduct admits of small excuse; if, as report
has it, the scene occurred at Woodley Park and
Robert Riddell subsequently took up the quarrel,
he is even less excusable. Whichever version one
accepts, Riddell was displaying innate snobbishness
towards a man he considered, after all, a social
inferior. If he was the host, realization of his own
share in the matter should have made him charitable;
if his brother was the host, Glenriddell was indulging
in violent and uncalled-for partisanship. He
held, it would seem, the same theory of a gentleman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
privileges as was enunciated a few years later
by Sir John Graham Dalyell: ‘I am a gentleman,
and I will be treated as such; and if any person presumes
to pervert my meaning in any way whatever,
if his rank is not equal to mine I will kick him; and
if it is equal I will shoot him.’ Burns, as a plebeian,
was kicked. There is a little satisfaction in knowing
that the poet held to his resolution not to apologize
to his host. The ‘Remorseful Apology’ supposed to
have been addressed to a Riddell was really sent,
early in 1796, to a Mr. S. Mackenzie. Four months
after the quarrel Glenriddell was dead, still unreconciled
to the poet who had done more for him than he
could ever have done for the poet. A loud blustering
squire, a hollow and unsubstantial mind; that was
Robert Riddell.</p>

<p>For the last five years of his life Burns’s social
world centred in Dumfries. About it cluster dark
stories and darker hints, in the effort to refute which
the poet’s defenders have sometimes been led to
dangerous extremities of special pleading. The truth
is that Burns in Dumfries was neither better nor
worse than Burns in Tarbolton and Mauchline.
Such a report as James Gray’s of finding Burns reading
poetry with his children and hearing the older
boys recite their lessons does not refute the tales of
boisterous revelry in taverns; both are true. The sole
difference is that Burns in Tarbolton was an unimportant
young man amid a group of other youths;
in Edinburgh he was partly lost in the crowds; in
Dumfries he was a prominent figure whose every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
action was noted. He did not degenerate in Dumfries,
but neither did he become a chocolate seraph.</p>

<p>Fortunately it is no longer necessary to rely on
conjecture and second-hand reports in studying
Burns’s last years. The letters which passed between
two of his most intimate friends, John Syme of Dumfries
and Alexander Cunningham of Edinburgh, are
now available to replace guess-work with facts. Of all
the friends of Burns’s last years, Syme is now the one
who emerges most clearly, and with most credit to
himself. A man of good education, a college friend
of Dr. James Currie, the poet’s first biographer,
Syme regarded Dumfries as a place of exile in which
Burns’s society was almost the only redeeming feature.
Having lost his small paternal estate of Barncailzie
near Kirkcudbright, he had managed to
recoup his fortunes by getting appointed to the
sinecure post of Collector of Stamps at Dumfries. He
first met Burns in 1788, but not until two years later
did they become intimate. Syme was a man of sentiment
in the best tradition of Henry Mackenzie and
<i>The Sorrows of Werther</i>. He went into raptures over
thunderstorms and desolate scenery; he read Zimmermann’s
<i>Treatise on Solitude</i>; he thought Clarinda’s
the finest love-letters ever written. Rhapsodic and
absent-minded, he was the sort who could set off on
a long-planned hunting-trip and find on arriving at
his destination that he had forgotten his dogs. Maria
Riddell paid warm tribute to his good head and excellent
heart, but added that in matters of business
he wanted method: ‘He is always in a labyrinth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
papers and accounts, and, somewhat like the cuttlefish,
he obscures himself altogether in a mist of his
own creating.’</p>

<p>Burns admired Syme’s education and literary
taste; Syme thought the poet ‘a noble fellow’, admired
his wit and brilliant conversation, but could
not admire his wife. ‘Methinks he has exhibited his
poetical genius when he celebrated her’, he said to
Cunningham after his first sight of Jean. Before long
Burns was submitting his new poems to Syme and
expressing implicit confidence in his judgement,
though Syme avowed that he scarcely dared to
touch a line of them. Sometimes the two would meet
in a boisterous crowd at a tavern; again they would
spend a quiet evening over a single bottle of wine in
the little croft of Ryedale which Syme regarded as
his refuge ‘from the frivolous and dissipated society’
of Dumfries. Without Burns, said Syme, his life in
the town would be ‘a dreary blank’. Syme had set
himself up as a clearing-house for humorous and
satirical verses written or collected by his friends,
and Burns quickly became the chief contributor to
the hoard. Some of the verses compelled caution in
sharing them. Of the epigram on the Loyal Natives
Club, for instance, Syme told Cunningham that,
though he and Burns were ‘far from differing from
them on sentiments of loyalty, we differ on <i>sentiment</i>,
abstractly considered. They scarcely know the
meaning of the word Sentiment, &amp; their Society
consists in roaring &amp; drinking.’ ‘Don’t,’ he added
after quoting the epigram, ‘let any Dumfries person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
see this, for one of the Savages, if he heard it, might
cut Robin’s pipe.’</p>

<p>Syme’s letters abundantly illustrate what he
meant by ‘frivolous and dissipated society’. When
the Caledonian Hunt met at Dumfries in November,
1794, ‘Baker, one of the knowing english
Squires on the Turf, made an elegant appearance
by insulting in the grossest manner Squire Walter
Riddel of this place, who pursued him to Durham
and made him ask pardon, which is published in
our papers of last week.’ On the same occasion the
Honourable Ramsay Maule of Panmure showed that
for once at least Burns was justified in the tone of a
satirical epigram, for Panmure and some drunken
companions smeared a helpless underling’s hair with
mustard and stuck it full of toothpick quills, ‘by way
of hedgehogging him’. That Burns gnashed his teeth
and passed by on the other side when he encountered
such members of the organization to which he
had dedicated his Edinburgh <i>Poems</i>, is no ground for
wonder. He had larded the Caledonian Hunt with
flattery, and they were behaving like cads and
bullies.</p>

<p>But though Burns shrank from the Caledonian
Hunt he did not always avoid similar company.
There were meetings at which he and Syme drank
bumpers out with wild Irishmen—such meetings as
led Thomas Telford the engineer jovially to warn
Burns that if he went on ‘in his old way, not even a
<i>she Devil</i> will be able to meet with a Milt in him.’
There was a drunken brawl with one Captain Dods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
who took hot exception to the poet’s toast, ‘May our
success in the present war be equal to the justice of
our cause.’ That Burns escaped a duel only because
he was not the Captain’s social equal did not lessen
his humiliation. Most biographers have held that
such a toast in the presence of gentlemen holding the
King’s commission was a huge breach of the proprieties,
and so it was—if Burns was not goaded into
giving it. Nothing in the record as it stands forbids
belief that Dods, or some other officer who knew
that Burns was suspected of sympathy with the
French, may have called for a round of loyal toasts
with the deliberate intention of embarrassing the
poet. In that case, nothing could have been neater
than Burns’s evasion, and since nothing came of the
episode it is to be presumed that Samuel Clarke succeeded
in making the sobered Dods realize what his
objection to the sentiment implied.</p>

<p>But there were other similar episodes which cannot
be so favourably explained, and which multiply
proof that Burns had never acquired finesse, whether
in toasting, flattering, or sinning. Whatever he did
was done so forthrightly that it attracted attention.
And the moment he attracted attention his companions
recollected that after all he was a peasant
received on sufferance into gentle company. The
outcome might be expulsion from the house for conduct
which a gentleman born need not even have
apologized for, it might be a verbal attack like Captain
Dods’s, or it might be merely a tacit resolve to
drop him forthwith. The Edinburgh experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
repeated itself in Dumfries. Burns’s ill-repute in certain
quarters during his life and after his death was
not owing to his being a sinner above the other
Caledonians, but simply to his lack of the social
standing which enabled Kames and Braxfield and
Boswell to misbehave without penalty, and which
would have tempered the sting of his satirical outbursts.</p>

<p>Occasional public drunken squabbles are not the
only evidence that during these last years Burns’s
nerves were often exacerbated. The loyal Syme
once undertook to rebuke him for some of his wild
doings and sayings. His language was too strong—telling
the story afterwards he admitted, ‘I may
have spoken daggers, but I meant none.’ The poet,
his face black with anger, fumbled with his sword-cane.
Syme, half laughing, half serious, exclaimed,
‘What! and in my own house, too!’ The conscience-stricken
Burns flung away the cane, burst into tears,
and positively grovelled in contrition on the flagstone
floor. It is not a pleasant scene, and though the
vividness with which it stayed in Syme’s memory is
indication enough that it was exceptional, it cannot
be ignored. No man, drunk or sober, whose nerves
were normal could have behaved so.</p>

<p>Fortunately the vividness of Syme’s memory is not
the only proof that such conduct was exceptional.
Others besides Syme who were nearest to Burns in
his last years concur in their loyalty and affection.
At the end of 1790 Alexander Findlater reported to
his official superior, Supervisor Corbet, that Burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
was ‘an active, faithful &amp; zealous officer’, gave ‘the
most unremitting attention to the duties of his office
(which, by the bye is more than I at first looked for
from so eccentric a Genius)’, and might ‘be considered
a credit to the profession’. And the judgment
which Findlater thus expressed at the beginning of
the poet’s Excise career he reaffirmed after his death.
Others testified to their regard in deeds as well as
words. Though Burns continued to display his life-long
preference for the company of extravagant and
<i>outré</i> sorts of people the best men in the Excise were
the ones who esteemed him most. John Lewars, for
example, brother of the Jessie of the songs, was a
man of some education, and above the level of the
common riding-officer. His father had been Collector
at Dumfries, and thus a man of standing in the
community. Burns called Lewars ‘a young fellow of
uncommon merit—indeed, by far the cleverest fellow
I have met with in this part of the world’, and
Lewars reciprocated the poet’s affection by service
to him and his family during his illness and after
his death. And that Burns’s long absence from duty
did not bear more heavily on him was due to the
kindness of Adam Stobbie, a young expectant who
throughout the spring of 1796 performed Burns’s
rounds without pay, that the poet might continue to
draw his full salary.</p>

<p>Fortunately, too, Syme records bright passages
as well as dark in the last years. There were evenings
at Ryedale when they consumed more cups of tea
than bottles of wine, and when ‘Robin’s confounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
wit’ played as sharply as it ever did over a
punchbowl. In 1793 and 1794 there were brief excursions
with Burns into Kirkcudbright on which
the mercurial poet displayed every facet of his nature,
bursting into furious rage over a spoiled pair
of boots, fulminating brilliantly satirical epigrams
against the Earl of Galloway, announcing that he
would dine nowhere where he could not ‘eat like a
Turk, drink like a fish and swear like the Devil’, and
anon proving a decorous and fascinating houseguest
at St. Mary’s Isle, seat of the Earl of Selkirk,
whose son Lord Daer had given Burns his first
glimpse of the peerage. Burns still shrank from the
ordeal of encountering such exalted folk—‘I am
indeed ill at ease whenever I approach your Honorables
&amp; Right Honorables’—though now for a different
reason. In 1786 the consciousness of his own
rusticity had been uppermost; in 1794 he did not
wish to be laid open either to a fresh snub or renewed
condescension. But his last recorded intercourse with
the peerage was as pleasant—and as dangerous—as
his first. The Earl of Selkirk was one of the few Scottish
peers who were Whigs at a time when all power
belonged to the Tories; thus meeting Burns on congenial
grounds he helped to draw him into the last
of his ill-advised meddlings with politics by interesting
him in the parliamentary campaign of Patrick
Heron of Heron. So to the last the peerage influenced
Burns against his own best interests. Nevertheless
this visit to St. Mary’s Isle is refutation
enough of the charge that in his last years Burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
had sunk so low that gentlefolk shunned him. The
man who so charmed the Earl’s young daughter,
Lady Mary Douglas, that she lent him a volume of
music and entered into correspondence about his
task of fitting Scottish airs with words, can scarcely
have been the social outcast some biographers have
portrayed. In fact, he strikingly resembles the man
who in 1787 swept the Duchess of Gordon off her
feet, and won the esteem of Lady Harriet Don and
the Dowager Countess of Glencairn.</p>

<p>Despite their intimacy, it would be false to claim
that Syme shared all Burns’s interests. No one man
could do that. The very topic on which Burns and
Lady Mary found common ground was outside
Syme’s range. He never could understand what
Burns saw in the crude and half-literate James Johnson,
because he never understood the bond of fellowship
established by mutual devotion to Scottish folk-song.
Nevertheless, Syme was probably the closest
to Burns of all his Dumfries friends, and knew—as
certain impassioned defenders like Anna Dorothea
Benson could not—the worst as well as the best in
his later conduct. The man who noted that ‘Robin’s
temper is not cold and frugal’, and who did not hesitate
to record the sword-cane story and certain other
episodes, cannot be charged with allowing affection
to obscure the full truth about his friend. Hence
Syme’s deeds and words at the time of Burns’s death
give as reliable a verdict on the poet’s last years as
can now be reached.</p>

<p>As Burns’s health failed in 1796 Syme watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
him with increasing anxiety. As long as he could he
hoped for recovery, but when the poet returned
from the Brow Well his ‘cadaverous aspect and
shaken frame’ told the truth which the doctors confirmed.
On July 17 Syme wrote to warn Cunningham
and to urge him to press their friend’s petition
to the Commissioners of Excise that they continue
his full salary. Two days later, when Syme called at
the little house in Mill Street, he saw the hand of
Death visibly fixed on Burns:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I cannot dwell on the scene. It overpowers me—yet
gracious God were it thy will to recover him! He had life
enough to acknowledge me, and Mrs. Burns said he had
been calling on you and me continually. He made a
wonderful exertion when I took him by the hand. With a
strong voice he said, “I am much better today—I shall
soon be well again, for I command my spirits &amp; my mind.
But yesterday I resigned myself to death.” Alas it will
not do.’</p>
</div>

<p>Syme was already consulting with Patrick Miller,
John M’Murdo, Dr. Maxwell, and other Dumfries
friends to set measures afoot for the welfare of Jean
and the children; when he wrote again on the 21st,
shaken by the ‘variety of distressful emotions’ stirred
by Burns’s death, he gave further details of their
plans, and urged Cunningham to launch a similar
plan in Edinburgh and to see that a proper obituary
was prepared. Here Cunningham blundered. He
entrusted the obituary to George Thomson, and the
latter’s remark that Burns’s ‘extraordinary endowments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
were accompanied with frailties which rendered
them useless to himself and his family’ roused
the Dumfries friends to indignation. ‘We were much
hurt at this,’ said Syme, ‘&amp; reckoned it indelicate, if
not unfeelingly superfluous on that occasion.’</p>

<p>These feelings were intensified by the appearance
in the London <i>Chronicle</i> of a longer article, also by
Thomson, which included assertions that Burns’s
‘talents were often obscured and finally impaired by
excess,’ that ‘his conduct and his fate afford[ed] but
too melancholy proofs’ of his possessing the failings
as well as the powers of genius, and that, ‘like his
predecessor Fergus[s]on, though he died at an early
age, his mind was previously exhausted.’ Thomson
had never been in Dumfries, and had never met
Burns. The friends in Dumfries who read his article
did not concur. Syme’s comment was brief and
pointed. These statements were ‘d——d illiberal lies’.
On that comment, by the man who knew him best
in his last years, the case for the defence of Burns
against the stories of his deterioration in Dumfries
may be allowed to rest.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">WOMEN</p>


<p>Burns was twenty-six before he ever entered the
home of a woman sufficiently well-to-do to have
carpets on her floors. Though the last ten years of
his life included many friendships with ladies, his
basic ideas of the other sex were the fruit of the
peasant environment he was reared in. His sentiment
and chivalry were literary by-products; underneath
them was always the crude realism of the
Ayrshire countryfolk. In moments of stress it was
only too apt to come to the surface.</p>

<p>The only subtlety the peasant women of Burns’s
youth could claim was that native to every daughter
of Eve. Schooling was too expensive to waste on
girls. The majority, like Agnes Broun, could not
write their own names; many could not even spell
out the Scriptures or the Psalms of David in metre.
Their fathers, their husbands, or the minister could
read the Bible to them, and thus they could obtain
the light of salvation at second hand. But this is
not to say that they knew no literature. In fact it
was only among an illiterate population that the
songs and ballads of popular tradition were living
realities. James Hogg’s mother spoke for her whole
class when she told Sir Walter Scott that he had
killed her ballads by writing them down. Learning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
to read destroyed both the sense of reality in the
traditional literature and the retentiveness of memory
which made its transmission possible. Had
Betty Davidson, Agnes Broun, and Jean Armour
been literate women they would not have furnished
Burns with the mass of traditional literature he
owed to them.</p>

<p>A girl’s real education in rural Scotland was obtained
in the kitchen, the dairy, and the fields. Almost
as soon as they could walk boys and girls alike
helped with the sheep and cattle and in all the work
of seedtime and harvest. As they grew older the girls
were trained more and more for the indoor duties of
which cooking was the smallest part. Most of the
clothing was made at home, from the carding and
spinning of the wool and flax to the sewing of the
finished webs into garments. Itinerant tailors made
the Sunday clothes of the men; all the rest was the
work of the women of the household. Add to these
activities the manifold duties of kitchen and dairy
and poultry yard and no peasant woman could have
reason to complain of lack of occupation. At harvest
time men and women alike turned out into the
fields, the men to mow with scythe and sickle, the
women and boys to bind and stack the sheaves and
to glean after the reapers.</p>

<p>It was from these barefooted illiterate lasses that
Burns got his first experiences in love and his whole
simple theory of the relations of the sexes. Woman
as the peasant knows her, sharing his daily toil, is
not a superior being set apart for adoration. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
is no mystery about her except the endless mystery
of sex. There may be companionship and a more
intimate sharing of the man’s interests than women
of higher rank attain. But the peasant woman cannot
expect and does not get the graces of deference.
Burns’s attitude towards the girls of his class differed
in one respect only from that of any other possessive
young male. He was a poet, and from the very beginning
poetry and sex were inextricably mingled.
When as a fifteen-year-old boy he helped Nellie Kilpatrick
to bind sheaves in the harvest field, and experienced
the primitive coquetry which sought his
help in extracting nettle and thistle stings from her
fingers, his first impulses were those of any adolescent
just becoming conscious of desire. But the second
impulse was different. Unable to possess Nellie,
he made a song about her.</p>

<p>As we have seen, courtship among the peasantry
was no private matter. Not only did everyone know
who was courting whom, but the aid of interested
friends was habitually enlisted in arranging trysts.
While still in his teens Burns displayed a command
of the written word—insufferably turgid though the
few surviving specimens of his early love-letters seem
to us—which made him the chosen secretary for his
less fluent cronies. He himself fell into love and out
again with ease and frequency. But his early sweethearts
are, like Nellie Kilpatrick, names and nothing
more. Burns’s statement that his relations with
women were entirely innocent until after he met
Richard Brown in 1781 is countered by Brown’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
charge that he was already fully initiated. As Henley
says, it is one man’s word against another’s; since
Burns was not in the habit of lying about his own
conduct we may believe him. Where, when, or with
whom his initiation took place is both uncertain
and unimportant. His own assertion that he ‘commenced
a fornicator’ with Betty Paton is subject to
the discount always to be charged against poetical
versions of prose facts. The certainty is that the
years following his return from Irvine were loaded
with emotional tension by three women—Elizabeth
Paton, Mary Campbell, and Jean Armour. Of the
three the one who has received the most attention
probably deserves the least.</p>

<p>No glamour of romance shields Betty Paton. A
servant of his mother’s at Lochlie and Mossgiel, she
succumbed willingly enough to the advances of the
young farmer whom his father’s death had just released
from tutelage, and in due course bore him a
daughter in the spring of 1785. According to Gilbert
Burns, Robert wanted to marry her, but was dissuaded
by his family, who feared that her coarseness
would soon disgust him. Perhaps so, but the only
contemporary letter does not include matrimonial
desire among the feelings it hints at. After the first
embarrassment wore off and he and Betty had duly
stood thrice before the congregation of Mauchline
Kirk to be admonished for their sin, Burns brazened
it out to the scandal of his stricter neighbours, and
Betty accepted it resignedly, knowing that such accidents
would happen and that they need not necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
impair her future career. Part of her resignation,
however, may have been conviction that
Robert Burns had insufficient prospects to make
marriage worth fighting for. In the fall of 1786,
when the Kilmarnock <i>Poems</i> had supplied her erstwhile
lover with a little ready cash, Betty promptly
demanded maintenance for herself and her child.
In settling the claim Burns apparently had to pay
over rather more than half his profits, besides legally
binding himself for the complete support and education
of his daughter. When on December 1, 1786,
she signed with her mark the legal discharge of her
claim, Betty Paton disappeared from Burns’s life.
She was a merry lass; her lover had paid for his fun;
the account was closed—except for the black-eyed
little girl being reared by a long-suffering grandmother
at Mossgiel.</p>

<p>Jean Armour’s case was different, though it commenced,
like Betty’s, in purely physical attraction.
To begin with, the status of the girls was different,
even though both were red-knuckled, barefooted
country lasses. Betty was merely a farm servant
whose family ties, whatever they were, were already
broken. Jean was the eighteen-year-old daughter of
James Armour, a well-to-do master-mason and contractor
in Mauchline. She was educated to the extent
of being able to read the Bible and write her
own name. The story of her first meeting with Burns
is probably legend, yet in spirit the anecdote is at
least partly true. Burns at a village dance, embarrassed
by a too-faithful collie which followed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
about the floor, remarked as he expelled the animal
that he wished he could find a lass to love him as
well as his dog did. Whether or not Jean actually
asked him a few days later, when he found her
bleaching linen on the green, if he had yet found
such a lass, the fact was that he had. From that
moment until his death Jean lavished upon him a
docile and much-enduring devotion which leaves
nothing derogatory in the comparison. She was playing
with fire and must have known it. The scandal
of Betty Paton was still fresh; Burns was a notorious
man, glorying in the reputation of village Lothario
and writing verses to warn the Mauchline belles how
devastating he was. Experience had convinced him
that all women are sisters under the skin—a dangerous
half-truth which made trouble for him when
he met women of another social level. They may all
be sisters under the skin, but not on it or outside it.
The fascination exerted so successfully over girls of
his own class was in fact disastrous training for subsequent
encounters with ladies. A lady may yield
to a lover like any peasant lass, but she expects some
finesse in his approach. But in the summer and
autumn of 1785 Burns seemed as likely to enter Edinburgh
drawing-rooms as to enter Parliament. He was
merely an unsuccessful tenant-farmer with a dangerous
talent for writing satirical verse and a dangerous
light in his eye when an attractive young
woman was in sight.</p>

<p>Between the tradition of his first meeting with
Jean in 1785 and the beginning of surviving references<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
to the affair in February, 1786, its history is a
blank. On the surface Jean’s experience merely repeated
Betty Paton’s. She surrendered to Burns and
in due course endured the consequences. Yet on
Burns’s side the cases were not alike. However
brazenly he may have begun his courtship he soon
found that Jean roused deeper emotions than Betty
ever had. His first extant reference to the affair,
apart from verses in praise of Jean’s charms, was on
February 17th, 1786, when he told John Richmond—who
after a similar scrape had fled to Edinburgh—that
he had important news ‘not of the
most agreable’ with respect to himself. In other
words, Jean had told him she was pregnant. Entirely
on his own initiative Burns undertook to do
the right thing he had successfully avoided, or been
dissuaded from, doing for Betty Paton. Sometime
in March he gave Jean, if not marriage lines, at
least some written acknowledgement that she was
or would be his wife. That he acted in a certain glow
of self-righteousness is a fair deduction from the
violence of his subsequent reaction. Rab Mossgiel,
the village Lothario, had behaved like a man of
honour and expected due recognition of his conduct.</p>

<p>The recognition he got was humiliating in the
extreme. The details can be reconstructed only by
inference from the result. Apparently Jean’s parents,
suspecting her condition, began to question her.
She produced Burns’s written pledge. A domestic
storm burst, not so much because Jean was to bear
Burns’s child as because he expected Jean to bear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
his name. To James Armour an illegitimate grandchild
was preferable to such a son-in-law as Robert
Burns. Jean meekly surrendered her lines to her
father—throughout her life she was usually passive
in the hands of male authority—and Armour carried
the document to Burns’s patron and friend, Robert
Aiken, whom he persuaded to cut out the names.
Not the least extraordinary element in the affair is
the apparent belief of a successful lawyer that a contract
could be voided merely by mutilating the
written evidence. Armour’s desire publicly to humiliate
Burns was greater than his desire to protect his
daughter. He succeeded admirably. In the same
letter in which the poet told Gavin Hamilton that
the document was mutilated he declared he ‘had
not a hope or even a wish to make her mine after
her damnable conduct’, yet amid his execrations he
paused to invoke a blessing on his ‘poor once-dear
misguided girl’. The letter was the first of a series of
denunciations and repudiations of Jean much too
loud and too shrill to be convincing. They suggest
that Burns had to talk at the top of his voice to
maintain the degree of indifference which he felt
self-respect called for.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing in Burns’s whole life more completely
demonstrates the impossibility of judging
him and the society in which he was reared by the
standards of nineteenth-century middle-class respectability.
When James Armour learned that the
subscription for the Kilmarnock <i>Poems</i> was a success
he showed that, though unwilling that his daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
should bear Burns’s name, he was quite willing she
should share Burns’s money. Accordingly he sued
out a writ <i>in meditatione fugae</i> to require Burns to
guarantee the support of Jean’s expected child. The
news reached Burns, probably from Jean herself,
and he acted promptly. By formal deed of assignment
he conveyed to Gilbert not only his share in
Mossgiel, but also the entire proceeds of his forthcoming
poems in consideration of Gilbert’s undertaking
to provide for Betty Paton’s child. Burns had
checkmated James Armour, and so doing had almost
evened the honours for ungenerous conduct. By
nineteenth-century standards his conduct was caddish,
but by the same standards Armour could have
done only one of two things—either expel his daughter
from his home, or protect her technical good
name by insisting upon marriage however distasteful
the prospective son-in-law was. But even by his own
standards Burns was acting ignobly. The man who
had written</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘But devil take the lousy loon</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Denies the bairn he got</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or leaves the merry lass he lov’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To wear a ragged coat,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and who less than six weeks after the deed of assignment
eloquently reproached John Richmond for
neglecting his late mistress and future wife and her
baby daughter, was allowing spite to degrade him
below the standards of the class to which he belonged
by birth, and much further below the standards he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
had consciously set for himself. This was not acting
according to the example of Harley the Man of
Feeling. If the episode stood by itself it might be
easier to condone. Unfortunately it is merely the
first conspicuous incident in a series which includes
his remarks about Jean to Clarinda and Bob Ainslie,
his neglect of Jenny Clow, his attack upon dead
Mrs. Oswald of Auchencruive, and his lampoons of
Maria Riddell, and which justifies Henley’s phrase
that such things ‘roused the cad’ in Burns. Where
women were concerned, it was always too easy for
him to drop the thin cloak of acquired culture and
revert to his peasanthood.</p>

<p>Alongside the Armour quarrel runs the mystery
of Mary Campbell. Burns himself began the mystery
by his curiously veiled allusions to the affair,
but the real work of obfuscation was done by biographers
who erected upon exiguous foundations of
fact an ornate superstructure of legend.</p>

<p>The exact date at which Burns composed the
‘Jolly Beggars’ is uncertain—if it was really written
after a slumming frolic with John Richmond it must
have been in 1785—but the closing episode is either
autobiography or prophecy. The Bard, whose sentiments
in the closing chorus are definitely Burns’s
own, is depicted with a doxy upon either arm. After
the stormy spring and summer of 1786 Burns confessed
to Robert Aiken that he had plunged into all
sorts of riot, Mason meetings, and dissipation, to
distract his mind from the humiliation of the Armour
affair. What form his dissipation took may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
reasonably be guessed not only from Burns’s own
temperament but from human nature in general.
Yet nothing about his relation with Mary Campbell
is free of doubt. All that can definitely be proved is
that there was a servant-lass of that name to whom
Burns apparently addressed certain lyrics and to
whom he certainly gave a pair of Bibles bearing
peculiar inscriptions. It is useless to rehearse the
endless controversy between the romantics to whom
Mary Campbell was a Lily Maid of Astolat and the
realists to whom she was just another girl who
couldn’t say no. But a few facts must be underscored.
The critical analysis of the legend made with caustic
humour by Henley in 1896 and subsequently elaborated
by Professor Snyder has never been rebutted
nor even answered. The scripture texts Burns wrote
on the fly-leaves of that Bible are such as would
have been chosen by a man to whom a frightened
girl was appealing for protection and who was impulsively
promising it on his word of honour as a
man and a Mason. That he also sang Mary’s praises
as ‘Highland Lassie’ and in another lyric asked—for
poetic effect at least—if she would go to the Indies
with him means little, if anything. The enthusiasts
prefer to forget that during the same summer Burns
said farewell to Eliza Miller in a lyric quite as fervid
as any of those addressed to Mary.</p>

<p>Out of the mass of legend and conjecture the only
solid facts which emerge are that during this spring
of 1786 Burns was having some sort of a love affair
with Mary; that she left Ayrshire in May, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
she died in the early autumn. Burns may have
turned to her for consolation after the breach with
Jean; the affairs may have been simultaneous. Most
biographers incline to the sequel theory on the
naïve assumption that love affairs, unlike electric
batteries, are always mounted in series and never in
parallel. In view of the social attitude of the Ayrshire
peasantry the question of whether or not Mary
was technically chaste is both metaphysical and
irrelevant. Burns’s attitude toward the other sex
was direct; perhaps the strongest argument for
Mary’s chastity would be the complete lack of reference
to her in his contemporary letters, were it
not for his subsequent description of her as ‘as
charming a girl as ever blessed a man with generous
love’. Burns ordinarily meant such expressions in
the most literal sense. Despite the evidence in the
Bibles that he had tried again to do the right thing
it is hard to believe that in retrospect Mary would
have touched him any more deeply than Jenny
Clow or Anne Park later did had it not been for her
untimely death. She certainly meant little in May
and June of 1786. In the same month in which he
gave her the Bible he composed the long and bawdy
‘Court of Equity’; throughout the summer his letters
to his intimates mingle execration, devotion,
and regret for Jean Armour in precisely the same
tones he had used in April. A man who had really
found an adequate new love might be supposed to
speak of the old one as Burns had spoken of Peggy
Thomson in 1784. Resentment of the Armours’ conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
might explain the execration, but hardly the
regret and certainly not the devotion. If Burns really
intended to make a new start in Jamaica with Mary
Campbell, it is strange indeed that he never hinted
of it to his friends—unless we accept the tradition,
reported at second hand from John Richmond, that
Mary was a light-skirts whose character Richmond
and some other friends exposed to the poet. In that
case, he would have had good reason for silence.</p>

<p>When in October he summed up his situation in
a long letter to Robert Aiken it was still Jean who
was the cause of his secret wretchedness and who
was the source of ‘the pang of disappointment, the
sting of pride, with some wandering stabs of remorse’.
The sole passage in the letter which Snyder
thought might apply to Mary—‘I have seen something
of the storm of mischief thickening over my
folly-devoted head’—may now be interpreted as referring
instead to the disconcerting reappearance of
Betty Paton as a claimant for support. The sole evidence
surviving from 1786, apart from Burns’s lyrics,
is his sister’s story, told many years after his death,
that one day in October he received a letter which
he read with a look of agony and then crushed into
his pocket as he silently left the house. Connecting
this story with Burns’s later statement that ‘a malignant
fever hurried my dear girl to her grave before
I could even hear of her illness’, biographers have
assumed that the painful letter bore the news of
Mary’s death. But this, even granting perfect reliability
to Isabella Begg’s memory, is pure assumption.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
Burns’s sole references to her were written from
three to five years after the supposed event. With
one exception they were intended for the mystification
rather than the enlightenment of Robert Riddell
and George Thomson. That exception is the
composition of ‘Thou Lingering Star’ and the letter
to Mrs. Dunlop which accompanied it—both of
them written in a neurotic state close to complete
nervous breakdown. The Highland Mary we know
is the creation of biographers, and should be suffered
to abide in the Never-Never Land of romance.
The truth about the Burns of flesh and blood had
better be sought in his relations with flesh and
blood women.</p>

<p>In these relations there were three main degrees.
The foremost group consists of women who profoundly
stirred him, and on whom for a time at
least he concentrated his intellect and his affections
as well as his desires. In this group belong Jean
Armour, Margaret Chalmers, Clarinda, and probably
Maria Riddell. Next come the women who
engaged his passing fancy, and for whom he felt
some tenderness, but who did not influence him
deeply or long. Among these are Betty Paton, Anne
Park, Jean Lorimer, and Jessie Lewars. A woman
who appealed to Burns on either of these bases need
not have been his mistress; in fact, only three of those
named ever yielded to him. But below these was a
third group, represented by Meg Cameron and
Jenny Clow, who were mistresses and nothing
more—the mere conveniences of the moment. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
last never roused even a momentary spark of poetry
in their lover. Judged purely on the basis of literary
by-product, Mary Campbell belongs in the second
group, but not in the first. Even her most ardent
champion might hesitate to assert that any lyric
addressed to her is the equal of ‘Ae fond kiss’ or ‘Of
a’ the airts’. Jessie Lewars and Jean Lorimer both
inspired better songs than Mary ever did.</p>

<p>But Burns’s tenderness, even for the women who
meant most to him, was often of a peculiar sort.
Though he told Deborah Davies that ‘Woman is the
blood-royal of life; let there be slight degrees of
precedency among them, but let them all be sacred’,
his practice was more accurately summarized
in what he said about love in confiding to George
Thomson his admiration for Jean Lorimer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘... I am a very Poet in my enthusiasm of the Passion.—The
welfare &amp; happiness of the beloved Object, is
the <i>first &amp; inviolate</i> sentiment that pervades my soul; &amp;
whatever pleasures I might wish for, or whatever might
be the raptures they would give me, yet, if they interfere
&amp; clash with that <i>first</i> principle, it is having these pleasures
at a dishonest price; &amp; Justice forbids, &amp; Generosity
disdains the purchase!—As to the herd of the Sex, who
are good for little or nothing else, I have made no such
agreement with myself; but where the Parties are capable
of, &amp; the Passion is, the true Divinity of love—the man
who can act otherwise than as I have laid down, is a
Villain!—’</p>
</div>

<p>One fears that Burns remained on these chivalrous
heights only when the woman was unattainable;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
should she yield to him, she would too readily take
her place among ‘the herd of the Sex’. Certainly he
freely discussed his loves not only among his male
friends but with a patroness like Mrs. Dunlop.
When, for instance, after his conquering hero’s return
to Mauchline in June, 1787, the Armours bade
him welcome and Jean succumbed once more, he
lost no time in reporting the victory to Smith and
Ainslie. To put it briefly, beneath the veneer of
sentiment, beneath even the poetic response, Burns’s
attitude towards women of his own age was the elemental
possessiveness which regards sex primarily
as a ribald jest. His sincerest tenderness belonged to
no woman as deeply as it did to his children, however
or wherever begotten.</p>

<p>Burns never revealed more truly his own feelings
than in the ‘Poet’s Welcome to his Bastart Wean’
which hailed the birth of his eldest child, Betty
Paton’s daughter. Its mixture of bawdry with affection,
of rollicking defiance of the unco guid with exultant
pride in paternity, may distress the tender-minded
who prefer not to admit the existence in
parental relations of even a sublimated carnality,
but it is the very essence of Burns himself. His plainest
expressions of his love for his children occur not
in letters to women but in letters to his most intimate
male friends, and often amid flagrant ribaldry. It
was not to Mrs. Dunlop that he wrote that Jean’s
first twins ‘awakened a thousand feelings that thrill,
some with tender pleasure and some with foreboding
anguish, thro’ my soul’; it was to Robert Muir, companion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
of his revels and recipient of broad jests.
Robert Aiken was told that the feelings of a father
outweighed in Burns all the sound reasoning and all
the bitter memories that joined in urging him to
carry through the Jamaica project. ‘God bless them,
poor little dears!’ he exclaimed to John Richmond
on reporting the birth of the twins. Such remarks to
men before whom he had no motive for acting a
part, are more convincing proof of real feelings than
are the dissertations, garnished with quotations from
James Thomson’s dramas, on parental anxieties in
his letters to Mrs. Dunlop.</p>

<p>Especially notable is the letter he wrote to Bob
Ainslie on August 1, 1787, in response to the latter’s
announcement of the birth of an illegitimate son.
Beginning, ‘Give you joy, give you joy, my dear
brother!’ he goes on to say that he has ‘double
health and spirits at the news’, and to welcome
Ainslie to ‘the society, the venerable Society of
Fathers’. There follow eight lines of the metrical
version of Psalm 127, obviously quoted with as much
sincerity as when he later used it, in quite different
context, in writing to John M’Auley. He continues,
‘My ailing child is got better, and the Mother is
certainly in for it again, and Peggy [Meg Cameron]
will bring me a half Highlandman’, and announces
his intention of getting a farm, bringing them all
up in fear of the Lord and of a good oak stick, and
of being the happiest man alive. Then the letter
shifts to snatches of bawdy song, some quoted, others
apparently impromptu. This primitive joy in paternity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
this exultation over the mere fact of birth,
whether the child was his own or another’s, was
part of his heritage from the Scottish soil. The same
spirit shows three years later in his reply to
Mrs. Dunlop’s news that her widowed daughter
Mrs. Henri had borne a posthumous son:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘... I literally, <i>jumped for joy</i>—how could such a
mercurial creature as a Poet, lumpishly keep his seat on
the receipt of the best news from his best Friend—I seized
my gilt-headed Wangee rod, an instrument indispensably
necessary in my left hand in the moment of Inspiration &amp;
Rapture—and stride—stride—quick &amp; quicker—out
skipt I among the broomy banks of Nith to muse over my
joy by retail.’</p>
</div>

<p>Nor did his paternal emotions dissipate themselves
in rejoicings over birth. Testimony abounds of his
devotion to his children, his concern over their
proper education, his anxiety for their futures.
James Gray on evening visits in Dumfries found him
explaining poetry to the eldest boy and hearing him
recite his lessons; Maria Riddell was impressed by
his constant devotion to the children’s welfare. But
towards their mothers, once the fancy had passed,
he was indifferent. ‘I am very sorry for it, but what
is done is done’, he said of Meg Cameron, and
though Clarinda’s rebuke stung him into something
like remorse for his treatment of Jenny Clow, even
there his last thought was for his son: ‘I would have
taken my boy from her long ago, but she would
never consent.’ The one possible exception to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
generalization was Jean Armour, but Jean’s later
history belongs elsewhere, beside Clarinda’s.</p>

<p>In brief, Burns’s experience among women up to
his departure for Edinburgh had made him the
‘magerfu’’ man Sentimental Tommy had longed to
be. His love-making might involve him in tangles
which he was neither astute nor callous enough to
avoid, but he had found his attraction enhanced by
his reputation as a dangerous man. He had learned
the value of aggressiveness; he had not learned
finesse. When he met ladies his lack sooner or later
became painfully evident.</p>

<p>Among women of the upper classes he was at his
best in association with those whose interest was
motherly rather than actually or potentially amorous.
Before going to Edinburgh he had charmed
middle-aged Mrs. Stewart of Stair as well as mature
Mrs. Lawrie, wife of the minister of Loudoun, and
had begun with Mrs. Dunlop a correspondence
which ended only on his deathbed. In its progress
this friendship reveals much of what was best in his
relations with women; in the estrangement which
interrupted it it reveals also his shortcomings. Since,
moreover, it is the only one of his friendships in
which both sides of the correspondence have been
preserved, no guess-work is required in tracing its
rise and decline.</p>

<p>Frances Anna Wallace Dunlop belonged by both
birth and marriage to the old landed gentry of Scotland,
and claimed collateral descent from Sir William
Wallace. In the autumn of 1786 her mind was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
‘in a state which, had it long continued my only
refuge would inevitably have been a mad-house or
a grave; nothing interested or amused me; all
around me served to probe a wound whose recent
stab was mortal to my peace, and had already
ruined my health and benumbed my senses.’ Grief
at her husband’s recent death had something to do
with it, but the chief wound was her eldest son’s extravagance
and marital scandals. About the beginning
of November a copy of the Kilmarnock
<i>Poems</i> reached her and her reading of them—significantly
enough it was ‘The Cotter’s Saturday Night’
and other poems based on the genteel tradition of
eighteenth-century poetry that won her admiration—roused
her to fresh interest in life. ‘The poignancy
of your expression’, as she put it, ‘soothed my
soul.’ To one reading her letters without reference
to her age she often sounds like a decrepit and almost
dying woman. Actually when she began writing
to Burns she was only fifty-six, and she outlived
him by nineteen years. She opened the correspondence
with an order for six copies of the poems; the
flattered poet could scrape together only five, which
he dispatched with a complimentary letter that included
the news that he was planning a second
edition in Edinburgh. Mrs. Dunlop immediately
elected herself one of his chief advisers, and among
other things suggested that in revising his poems he
should avoid describing her great ancestor as ‘unhappy
Wallace’ and should make the Twa Dogs sit
down more decorously. Later she offered the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
most inept of all the recorded plans for the poet’s
future. In February, 1787, she proposed that he
should use the proceeds of his Edinburgh subscription
to buy a commission in the army. The man
who wrote ‘I murder hate by field or flood’ and
whose dislike for ‘the lobster-coated puppies’ of the
army more than once got him into hot water would
have cut a strange figure in any officers’ mess. On
April 1, 1789, she suggested his applying for the
newly established Professorship of Agriculture at
Edinburgh University. The self-taught peasant
would have cut a still stranger figure as the colleague
of Robertson, Cullen, and Blair.</p>

<p>The history of the first few months of his friendship
with Mrs. Dunlop reveals how far Burns was
from understanding the finer points of etiquette. To
begin with he ignored her suggestions for altering his
poems. True, he could do nothing else. Her advice
was merely typical of what genteel Scotland thought
about his work. To accept all emendations would
have reduced his poems to namby-pamby; to accept
some and reject others would have doubly
offended those whose criticism he ignored. But he
should have explained this to Mrs. Dunlop, and did
not. Her vexation at the discovery was intensified by
an innocent blunder he made in arranging for the delivery
of copies she had ordered for her stepmother, the
dowager Lady Wallace of Craigie. The copies went
instead to the estranged wife of her eldest son, also a
Lady Wallace but regarded by her mother-in-law as
the worst blemish the family tree had ever suffered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Their relations were first put on a really cordial
basis when Burns visited her at Dunlop House in
July, 1787. Annoyance at his social blunders evaporated
before the charm of his personality, and
thereafter the correspondence on both sides took a
new tone of affection and esteem. Her interest in
Burns was generous and motherly. She plied him
with good advice, which he generally ignored, and
frequently added substantial help with both money
and influence. Towards her Burns seems to have
felt as many a man does towards his mother—she
bored him but he loved her. She often accused him,
no doubt justly, of not reading her letters. They
were long, tedious, and wholly unpunctuated; he
probably glanced over them when they arrived and
then laid them aside for more careful reading at a
leisure hour which never came. But though he seldom
answered her questions he took her unreservedly
into his confidence—or almost unreservedly.
He never did more than hint about Clarinda, but
he told her everything about Jean. In fact he
must have told almost too much; it is hard otherwise
to explain his embarrassment over breaking
the news that he had finally married the girl who
had borne him ‘twice twins in seventeen months’.</p>

<p>By the beginning of 1788 the friendship was so
firmly established as to survive a most humiliating
incident. When he visited Dunlop House on his way
back from Edinburgh in February his reception was
warm and flattering. Mrs. Dunlop’s unmarried
daughters were agog with admiration. Miss Rachel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
was hard at work on a painting of his muse, Coila,
as to whose appearance she sought the poet’s expert
advice. Miss Keith discussed poetry with him and
revealed the somewhat surprising fact that she had
never read Gray. Before he left he had promised to
lend the ladies his copy of Spenser, a recent gift from
William Dunbar of Edinburgh. When a few days
later he fulfilled his promise he added to the parcel
a copy of Gray as a present for Miss Keith, only to
learn that a plebeian poet must not presume too far.
Mrs. Dunlop replied that she did not allow her
daughter to receive presents from men who were
not members of her own family, and proposed either
to return the whole book or at most to permit
Miss Keith to tear out the pages containing the
poems she liked best. That Burns continued in
friendship with Mrs. Dunlop after this rebuff is eloquent
proof of the esteem in which he held her; he
had lampooned others of the gentry for less.</p>

<p>Not that this was the only time when Mrs. Dunlop
made him conscious of the difference in their
ranks. Her occasional gift of a five-pound note,
though usually tactfully designated as for some
special purpose or occasion, always hurt his pride—the
more so because he could not deny that he
needed the money. He silently drew the line, however,
when she proposed, in one of those fits of
economy which sometimes afflict the well-to-do,
that he help to sell some decorative fringe which she
had been manufacturing. Over this as over others
of his sins of omission she displayed an irritability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
more like a schoolgirl’s than a grandmother’s; most
schoolgirlish in its evanescence. A thorough scolding
which sounded like a total breach of relations would
be countered by some new poems or new compliments
from Burns, and her next letter would contain
a five-pound note for the latest baby.</p>

<p>Though as Burns became more heavily burdened
with labour and responsibility his letters grew
shorter and fewer than at the peak of the correspondence
during the summer of 1788, no serious
rift appeared until December, 1792. When it came
it was the result of Burns’s pride working in combination
with his want of tact. Among the servants
on Mrs. Dunlop’s estate was a milkmaid named
Jenny Little, whom Burns’s success had inspired to
burst into rime. Burns had already endured a good
deal of her output, both from manuscripts sent to
him by Mrs. Dunlop and from a pilgrimage of
adoration which Jenny had made to Ellisland in
1790—an unsuccessful pilgrimage, for she had found
the poet laid up with a broken arm and in no mood
for entertaining an aspiring poetess. When Burns
reached Dunlop in 1792 he found his patroness’s interest
in her protégée still unshaken. With her assistance
Jenny had recently printed her poems, and
Mrs. Dunlop produced the volume with the request
that Burns give his opinion of certain of the verses
which she pointed out. He said, ‘Do I have to read
all those?’ in a tone which she afterwards described
as the equivalent of a slap in the face.</p>

<p>It was supreme tactlessness. Burns was bored and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
showed it. A more politic man would have waded
through the verses however much his jaw might
ache with suppressed yawns. But boredom was not
the worst aspect of the incident from Burns’s point
of view: his pride was wounded. Of all his patrons
in the upper ranks of society Mrs. Dunlop alone
had kept up her interest in him and had appeared to
treat him as an equal. Now she unconsciously revealed
that she saw no <i>essential</i> difference between
his writing and Jenny Little’s. To her he was after
all merely a peasant poet with the accent on the
adjective; the difference between him and Jenny
Little was a difference in degree and not in kind.
Both wrote in dialect; she failed to see that one
wrote Scots poetry and the other Scots twaddle.</p>

<p>The incident illustrates once more what Maria
Riddell meant when she described Burns as devoid
in great measure of refinement and social graces.
The abrupt and masterful manner, successful with
the girls of his own original class, sooner or later
annoyed other ladies besides the Duchess of Gordon.
Mrs. Dunlop, however, did not allow her vexation
to cause an immediate coolness; she contented herself
with a lengthy silence followed by an explanation
of her reasons for being offended. Yet when
the real break came two years later Burns’s unbridled
tongue and pen were again at fault.
Mrs. Dunlop heartily disapproved of his sympathy
with the French Revolution, and had warned him
more than once to drop the subject in his letters.
Inasmuch as four of her sons and one grandson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
were or had been in the army and two of her daughters
were married to French royalist refugees, Burns
should have known that her sympathies would be
Tory. Yet in face of her warnings he wrote in January,
1794, the most outspoken of all his political
remarks, describing Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette
as a perjured blockhead and an unprincipled
prostitute who had met their deserved fate at the
hangman’s hands, and adding a guarded hope that
revolutionary principles might have more scope in
England. This time Mrs. Dunlop broke off the correspondence.
Though Burns made two attempts
during the next year to reopen it, she maintained
dogged silence until his pathetic letter of farewell,
written on his deathbed, at last broke down her reserve.
Her letter of reconciliation was almost the
last message which reached him before his death.
For a century charitable biographers conjectured
that the estrangement must have been due to the
lady’s hearing reports that Burns was living an
evil life in Dumfries. The recovery of the complete
text of his letter of January, 1794, revealed the
simple truth that the breach resulted from nothing
more serious than a failure in tact. There, as always,
his trouble came because he had not taken heed to
his ways, that he offend not with his tongue.</p>

<p>The same trouble underlay his relations with
other women of a rank above his own—Margaret
Chalmers, Agnes M’Lehose, and Maria Riddell,
though in different ways and different degrees. With
Margaret Chalmers, indeed, he maintained for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
couple of years the nearest approach he ever made
to a non-flirtatious friendship with a woman of his
own age, but of the three just named this clever
daughter of a gentleman farmer in Ayrshire was the
least removed in station from himself. Unfortunately,
only Burns’s side of the correspondence survives,
and that in fragments. Apparently it began,
as usual, with love-making, but when Margaret
gently put a stop to that—probably by telling Burns
that she was already engaged to Lewis Hay, whom
she married in 1788—their relation ripened into a
genuine friendship which produced what Cromek
rightly called some of the best letters Burns ever
wrote. The poet took her unreservedly into his confidence
about his troubles with Creech and his
anxiety over his future, so that his three or four letters
to her during the height of his correspondence
with Clarinda come like a breath of bleak but pure
air in that hothouse atmosphere. But the friendship
ended, apparently through Burns’s neglect. Two
years after her marriage he sent regards to her
through another friend, and called himself a wretch
for not writing her, but seemingly he could not
write when he felt that his confidences might be
shared with her husband. An estranged husband
would not have mattered, as his flirtation with Agnes
M’Lehose proved.</p>

<p>The Clarinda episode has more prominence in
most accounts of Burns than it deserves. In its beginning
and growth it was in fact quite untypical
of the man—his one intensive effort to act a part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
not natural to him. Its development in this way was
mainly the result of the accident which threw him
back on letter-writing instead of speech in conducting
his suit. Agnes M’Lehose when Burns met her
was a plump young matron about his own age.
Born Agnes Craig of Glasgow and a relative of one
of the Lords of Session, she had married in romantic
haste at the age of seventeen a young lawyer named
James M’Lehose, and when Burns met her had already
had eleven years of leisure to repent. Her
husband, after abusing and neglecting her and getting
into debt and disgrace, had at last been exiled
by indignant relatives to Jamaica—that tropical
refuge for Britons who had made their native climate
too hot for them. His wife, trying to rear three sickly
children on a microscopic annuity, had turned for
consolation to literature and religion. In the latter
she had espoused under the dynamic preaching of
the Rev. John Kemp the strictest tenets of Calvinism;
in the former she had familiarized herself with
the most elegant authors of the day and had taken
to versifying occasionally with the fluency and inaccuracy
prevalent among women poets prior to
Christina Rossetti and Emily Brontë. Like most of
Edinburgh in 1787 she had been eager to meet
Burns. When at last she did so at a tea-party given
by her friend, Miss Erskine Nimmo, she and Burns
became so visibly absorbed in each other as to
rouse the amusement of the other guests. The poet’s
experiences hitherto with young women of the
upper classes had been disappointing. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
polite and attentive, but reserved. Here at last was
an indubitable lady, and a young and attractive one
at that, who displayed something like the enthusiastic
attention he had been accustomed to receive
from the belles of Mauchline. Before the tea was
over Burns had accepted Mrs. M’Lehose’s invitation
to a party of her own. If ever a woman threw
herself at a man’s head Agnes M’Lehose did, and
Burns was not the man to refuse such a challenge.
A letter to Richard Brown in the early days of his
infatuation leaves no doubt that he thought he had
made a conquest; but he had reckoned without
Clarinda’s Calvinism and her social traditions.</p>

<p>The affair might have spent itself in a passing
flirtation had not chance, in the form of a drunken
driver who overturned a coach and dislocated the
poet’s knee, confined him to his room for several
weeks. His note explaining and deploring his inability
to attend the tea-party was answered by
one offering sympathy and regret. Burns and
Mrs. M’Lehose both wielded free-flowing pens; their
correspondence rapidly gained momentum and fervour.
By the third exchange of letters she felt it her
duty to remind him that she was a married woman.
The result may or may not have been what she intended.
Assuring her that his intentions were strictly
honourable Burns seized the opportunity to express
far more ardent chivalry and devotion than he
would probably have ventured on had she been
free. In reply she suggested their writing under Arcadian
pseudonyms—no doubt as evidence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
strictly Platonic nature of their sentiments; displayed
her acquaintance with <i>The Spectator</i> by calling herself
Clarinda; and suggested Sylvander for Burns.
Having thus safely wrapped their correspondence in
asbestos they relaxed in a vapour-bath of emotion.</p>

<p>Less than three weeks after Burns’s accident he
was assuring Clarinda that she was a gloriously
amiable fine woman and was promising life-long
devotion. But he was not admitting her as yet into
his inner doubts and perplexities. Margaret Chalmers
was the only woman who shared those. In fact
both Sylvander and Clarinda seemed to have reserved
their more intimate communications for
personal speech. Apparently not until their long-deferred
second meeting in January did Burns tell
her about Jean and his children and Clarinda give
him the whole tale of her unhappy marriage. She
also sought in both speech and writing to convert
him to Mr. Kemp’s particular brand of Calvinism.
But here even at the height of his infatuation she
failed. The most she got was a partial recantation of
his liking for the heroic qualities of Milton’s Satan.</p>

<p>So long as communication was limited to pen and
ink the affair for Burns was little more than a literary
exercise. After they began to meet it became
different and, in its effects on him, worse. Physical
nearness could not fail to stir a man of his temperament.
Soon their conversation was supplemented by
caresses which Clarinda, however, managed to keep
within bounds. As a result, Burns left these interviews
with his blood at fever heat. A servant-girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
named Jenny Clow, successor to the Meg Cameron
of the previous winter, provided the consummation
which Clarinda denied, and in due course added
yet another to his growing list of paternal, legal,
and emotional perplexities.</p>

<p>Clarinda was of course unaware of Jenny’s existence,
but she soon had other reasons for being uncomfortable.
Edinburgh was not a city in which a
gentlewoman could be indiscreet and get away with
it. More than a dozen years later Euphemia Boswell
told Joseph Farington that Edinburgh’s chief drawback
was that everybody knew all his neighbours’
affairs. The poet’s visits to the Potterrow were freely
discussed. Lord Craig heard of them and was annoyed
by his kinswoman’s indiscretion; the Rev.
Mr. Kemp heard of them and felt it his duty to admonish
his parishioner. When Clarinda confided
these troubles to Burns they of course roused him to
new fervours of knight-errantry. Moreover, other
agitations were intensifying the emotional stress of
the love affair. A great lady named Mrs. Stewart
who was expected to help his Excise project chose
to lecture him on the error of his ways; rumours
were afloat that William Creech was insolvent;
above all there was bad news from Mauchline.
Jean’s parents had this time chosen the heavy
melodramatic role and had bidden their erring
daughter not to darken their doors again. She was
being sheltered by friendly Mrs. Muir of Tarbolton
Mill, but her future was black. In these circumstances
it is unjust in the extreme to judge Burns’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
conduct by the cool standards of sobriety and sanity.
The man was in such a state of frenzy that he cannot
be held accountable for his words nor even for all
his actions.</p>

<p>What had begun as a flirtation and had continued,
in part at least, as a piece of play-acting had by
the middle of February become an imbroglio. Burns
and Clarinda, both of them sentimentalists whose
roused emotions were stronger than their reason, had
gone so far that they could no longer regard their
relations as simple friendship. By the time Burns set
out on the 18th for Mauchline by way of Glasgow
he had indulged in a perfect delirium of sentiment
and rash vows. If he had not actually pledged himself
to wait until James M’Lehose should be considerate
enough to die and leave Clarinda free to marry
Sylvander it at least appears that she expected him
to wait. Meanwhile they were to write to each other
every day.</p>

<p>The artificial and hothouse nature of the affair is
fully demonstrated by the change which came over
Burns’s letters as soon as removal from Edinburgh
plunged him into the chilly air of everyday. The
promise of a daily letter was the first to fail. Burns
reached Glasgow on the evening of the 18th to find
Richard Brown awaiting him at the Black Bull Inn
in the company of young William Burns, who had
ridden up from Mauchline with his brother’s horse.
Before settling to a convivial evening Burns managed
to dispatch a hurried note to Clarinda, but it
was four days before he found time to write again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
His next letter shows how effectively those four days
had brought him back from a sentimental dream-world
to crude reality. Doubtless William had
brought the latest bulletins about Jean, but no hint
of them was passed on to Clarinda. A feverish day of
entertainment among the prosperous weavers of
Paisley was followed by two days of more decorous
pleasure at Dunlop House and then by another wild
bout at Kilmarnock. The letter from Kilmarnock is
devoted mainly to a broadly humorous account of
his Paisley host’s troubles with a daughter who had
been to boarding school, a son who wanted a latchkey,
and himself who thought it better to re-marry
than to burn. Not a word about Jean, scarcely a
word about worthy Mrs. Dunlop and none about
artistic Miss Rachel and poetic Miss Keith—in
short, just such a letter as Burns might have written
to Bob Ainslie or Alexander Cunningham, and in
comparison with all the previous Clarinda correspondence
as inappropriate as Falstaff in love.</p>

<p>But this letter jars on the reader only because it is
wrong in its context. Two which he wrote after his
arrival at Mauchline on the 23rd jar for a different
reason. Only one of these, however, was to Clarinda.
She had given him a couple of little shirts for Baby
Robert, who was being cared for at Mossgiel. As
soon as he had delivered these and seen his family,
Burns set off to interview ‘a certain woman’ at Tarbolton
Mill. ‘I am disgusted with her; I cannot endure
her! I, while my heart smote me for the prophanity,
tried to compare her with my Clarinda:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
’twas setting the expiring glimmer of a farthing taper
beside the cloudless glory of the meridian sun. Here
was tasteless insipidity, vulgarity of soul, and mercenary
fawning; there, polished good sense, heaven-born
genius, and the most generous, the most delicate,
the most tender Passion. I have done with her
and she with me.’</p>

<p>Of the many things in Burns’s life which might
better have been left unsaid or undone this letter
might claim first place were it not for the one he
wrote to Bob Ainslie ten days later. Here he describes
his reconciliation with Jean. What makes this
letter revolting is not so much its biological detail as
the realization that the alleged events which Burns
describes occurred less than a fortnight before Jean’s
confinement. On March 3 she again bore her lover
twins, who did not live even long enough to be
baptized. Still worse, if it is true, is his assertion that
he had sworn Jean ‘privately and solemnly never to
attempt any claim on me as a husband, even though
anybody should persuade her she had such a claim,
which she has not, neither during my life nor after
my death. She did all this like a good girl....’
Here, however, it is more than possible that he was
talking brazenly for Ainslie’s edification; Henley’s
doubt that Mrs. Armour could have been reconciled
to her daughter without a promise of marriage seems
well founded. Moreover the statement proves that
by this time, whatever he may have thought in 1786,
Burns realized that the destruction of the original marriage
lines had not necessarily voided the contract.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Whatever he said or did at his first interview with
Jean he must, before he returned to Edinburgh in
March, have made up his mind that sooner or later
he would acknowledge Jean as his wife. The letters
to Clarinda during the remaining two weeks of his
absence were noticeably lacking in fervour. They
contained, however, more news about his personal
affairs, especially the doubts and uncertainties that
still kept him hesitating between farming and the
Excise, than any of the earlier ones did. An unsolved
mystery in his life is the nature of his relations with
Clarinda during the fortnight he spent in Edinburgh
in March. To the modern reader with full knowledge
of the facts the fervour of his latest letters seems
still more forced and artificial than before, but it
may be questioned if this truth was equally obvious
to Clarinda. Indeed their final meeting, at which
Burns presented her with a pair of drinking-glasses,
a poem, and an inscribed copy of Young’s ‘Night
Thoughts’, clearly had enough romantic intensity to
satisfy even Clarinda. Herein lies the mystery. The
later developments prove that Burns had told her
nothing of his reconciliation with Jean, yet Burns
was not a man who could ordinarily act a part convincingly.
This time he must have tried. The results,
combined with anxiety over livelihood, are displayed
in a letter of March 20, in which he told
Richard Brown that worry over his lease, ‘racking
shop accounts’ with Creech, ‘together with watching,
fatigue, and a load of care almost too heavy for
my shoulders, have in some degree actually fever’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
me.... These eight days, I have been positively
crazed.’</p>

<p>He returned to Mauchline on the 22d to receive
his six weeks of Excise instructions, publicly to acknowledge
Jean as his wife, and incidentally to compose
a formula whereby to explain his action to his
friends and patrons:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I had a long and much-loved fellow creature’s happiness
or misery in my determination, and I durst not trifle
with so important a deposite.’</p>
</div>

<p>This statement with only slight variations he used to
half-a-dozen different correspondents. Whether he
used it to Clarinda or not is uncertain; he may have
entrusted Ainslie with the delicate task of breaking
the news. However the news reached her, it quite
naturally angered her. If Burns wrote it to her she
destroyed the letter, and we know that he destroyed
her reply calling him a Villain and accusing him of
perfidious treachery. When he visited Edinburgh
again in February, 1789, she refused to see him and
told Ainslie that she intended to keep away from her
windows while he was in town lest she catch a
glimpse of him in the street.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1791, however, she had a chance to
reopen the correspondence. Jenny Clow in June,
1788, had undertaken some sort of legal action
against Burns and one purpose of his return to
Edinburgh in the following February had been to
settle with her. Whatever the nature of the settlement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
it had not helped much. When in 1791 Jenny
somehow communicated with Clarinda, the latter
found the girl ill, destitute, and friendless, in a miserable
lodging. Clarinda’s discovery of the means
whereby Sylvander had managed to keep his courtship
on so lofty a plane must have been humiliating
and disillusioning, but she was woman enough to
turn her discovery to account. Her letter to Burns
described Jenny’s condition briefly and effectively
and suggested that there was a striking contrast
between his practice and the high principles of
generosity and humanity which he professed. She
meant her letter to sting, and it did. Burns begged
her to relieve Jenny’s immediate needs and promised
personal action at the first opportunity. At this
point Jenny vanishes from the record. What Burns
did, whether Jenny lived or died, whether her son
lived or died, if he lived what became of him—all
these are questions without answers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Clarinda had been attempting to re-establish
her own life. Her husband had sought a
reconciliation, and she was planning to join him in
Jamaica. When Burns made his last visit to Edinburgh
in November, 1791, her departure was already
arranged. She was fully reconciled to Sylvander
now, and for the first time their relationship
revealed simple and genuine emotion. The Arcadian
names vanished in the correspondence; she became
‘my dearest Nancy’ instead of Clarinda, and when
Burns returned to Dumfries, fully convinced that he
had said farewell forever, he produced the one really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
first-rate lyric Clarinda ever inspired—‘Ae Fond
Kiss, and Then We Sever’.</p>

<p>The sequel was the last of the anti-climaxes which
marked the affair. Clarinda reached Jamaica to
find James M’Lehose’s disposition not sweetened by
time, and a brood of mulatto children proved that
he had not suffered by her absence. She returned to
Scotland on the same ship which took her out. For
some time after her return she did not communicate
with Burns. When she did so it was in terms of cautious
esteem which inspired him to so bombastic a
reply that he shortly afterwards tried to disguise its
date by describing a transcript of it as ‘the fustian
rant of enthusiastic youth’. The first part of the description
is accurate. For Burns the episode was
closed, and closed, as it had opened, in posturing
affectation of emotion. But Clarinda lived on it for
the rest of her long life, exhibiting his letters to her
friends after his death until some of them were worn
to tatters. Her caution, however, equalled her vanity.
After some of the letters had been surreptitiously
transcribed and published in 1802 she went over the
manuscripts, destroying the addresses, scoring out
or clipping away proper names and erasing some of
the more ardent love-making, and being reduced at
last in senile old-age to selling some of them for a
few shillings each. Sylvander’s was the happier fate
after all.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, whatever bombast or adoration her
husband was addressing to Clarinda, the ‘certain
woman’ was lavishing on Burns the devotion he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
wished for at his first meeting. Various stories are
told of how and when he acknowledged Jean as his
wife. The probability is that he never did so, in the
sense of going through a formal marriage service.
On April 28th he confided to James Smith that
‘Mrs. Burns’ was Jean’s ‘private designation’; a
month later, in a letter to Ainslie, he avowed the
title ‘to the World’. By Scots law, avowal in the
presence of witnesses constituted a legal, though irregular,
marriage; a peculiar letter to Smith at the
end of June suggests that Burns even evaded this
legal requirement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I have waited on Mr. Auld about my Marriage affair,
&amp; stated that I was legally fined for an irregular marriage
by a Justice of the Peace.—He says if I bring an attestation
of this by the two witnesses, there shall be no more
litigation about it.—As soon as this comes to hand, please
write me in the way of familiar Epistle that, “Such things
are.”’</p>
</div>

<p>In other words, he was asking Smith—who had not
lived in Mauchline for two years—to testify, but not
on oath, that Burns had acknowledged the marriage
in his presence. Armed with Smith’s letter, and another,
he then presented himself again before the
minister, who overlooked the doubtful legality of
the evidence as two years before he had allowed
Burns’s doubtful status as a bachelor. On August 5th
Burns and Jean made their formal appearance before
the Kirk Session, avowed their marriage as of
1786, and were readmitted to the communion after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
‘Mr. Burns gave a Guinea note for the behoof of the
Poor.’</p>

<p>All this time Burns was alternating between
Mauchline and Ellisland, to the detriment of his
interests in each place. A man absent from his farm
every other fortnight could scarcely expect work to
go forward quickly, but there were no living accommodations
for Jean and young Robert until in
October a neighbour, moving into Dumfries for the
winter, offered Burns the use of his house. But the
periods of absence roused Burns once more to lyric
fervour for Jean, and the man who six months
earlier had pledged undying devotion to Clarinda
composed ‘Of a’ the airts’ in tribute to his wife.</p>

<p>But it was the last song that can with complete
certainty be connected with Jean. She sank before
long to the status of a hard-working, child-bearing
domestic fixture, losing her good looks—at first sight
of her in 1790 John Syme concluded that Burns’s
lyrics in her praise were poetic licence—but keeping
her equable temper and her devotion to her husband.
Of all the women who had loved Burns more
or less, and whom he, more or less, had loved, she
alone had to live with him. And yet she continued to
love him, not weighing his merits, but pardoning his
offences. She had things to pardon, though when he
married her Burns thought he had shaken himself
‘loose of a very bad failing.’ Eighteen months after
this announcement of reformation, Jean went home
to Ayrshire for a visit, and her husband strayed into
the arms of Anne Park at the Globe Inn. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
blonde barmaid in due course bore him a child, and
died in doing it, Jean took in the little girl and reared
her with ‘no distinction shown between that and the
rest of their children.’ Maria Riddell, whose words
are just quoted, added that Burns told her the story
‘with much sensibility’.</p>

<p>Burns could not take Jean into the society to
which he was himself admitted, so she remained unnoticed
at home, tending the children and keeping
the house in slatternly Scots fashion, but with a sober
Scots thrift which probably accounted for her
husband’s living within his income and at last dying
with little more than the debts incurred during his
final illness. Burns seldom spoke of her in his last
years, but when he did so it was ‘with a high tribute
of respect and esteem’. Maria Riddell—perhaps a
prejudiced witness—states that ‘he did not love her,
but he was far from insensible to the indulgence and
patience, “the meekness with which she bore her faculties”
on many occasions very trying to the tempers
of most individuals of our sex.’ One suspects, sometimes,
that Burns would never have continued to
love any woman after he had won her; that no matter
who she was, he might still have summed up his
marriage as he did to John Beugo:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Depend upon it, if you do not make some damned foolish
choice, [marriage] will be a very great improvement on
the Dish of Life.—I can speak from Experience, tho’ God
knows my choice was random as Blind-man’s buff. I like
the idea of an honest country Rake of my acquaintance,
who, like myself, married lately.—Speaking to me of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
late step, “L—d, man,” says he, “a body’s baith cheaper
and better sair’t!”’—</p>
</div>

<p>Maria Riddell may have been one reason for
Burns’s abrupt closure of the correspondence with
Clarinda in 1793. After Clarinda had refused to continue
it as an emotional communion he no longer
needed it as an intellectual one. He had found a
woman friend who surpassed Clarinda as much in
intellect as she did in social position, and the only
occasion on which he reopened communications
with Agnes M’Lehose was during his subsequent estrangement
from Mrs. Riddell—when he used the
opportunity to send Clarinda copies of the crude
lampoons he had composed upon Maria.</p>

<p>Walter Riddell, younger brother of Burns’s friend
at Friars Carse, had compressed a good deal of experience
into the first twenty-eight years of his life.
After a short period in the army he had married an
heiress who within a year made him a widower and
the owner of an estate in Antigua. In 1790 he met at
St. Kitts Maria Banks Woodley, youngest daughter
of the governor of the Leeward Islands, and after a
brief courtship married her when she still lacked two
months of being eighteen. Though Maria’s mother
was a native of St. Kitts, the girl had been born and
educated in England and soon after their marriage
the young couple returned there.</p>

<p>According to one interpretation of a letter from
Francis Grose to Burns in January, 1791, they must
have proceeded at once to an autumn visit at Friars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Carse, where Grose was also a guest. Grose told
Burns that ‘after the Scene between Mrs. Riddell
Jun<sup>r</sup> and your humble Servant, to which you was
witness, it is impossible I can ever come under her
Roof again.’ The letter also refers to the Governor—‘a
spoilt Child with a Number of good Qualities’—whom
its editor identifies as Walter Riddell,
Mrs. Riddell Junior being Maria. But there was
also an extremely senior Mrs. Riddell at Friars
Carse, for Robert’s grandmother lived with him.
Hence the Junior may equally well have been
Mrs. Robert Riddell, and inasmuch as Maria had
no roof of her own in Scotland until 1792, it is
hard to see how any misconduct of hers could have
shut Friars Carse to Grose.</p>

<p>If this was really Maria’s first meeting with Burns
it was an inauspicious start. But the early stages of
the friendship are obscure. The extant correspondence
does not begin until February, 1792, and by
that time Maria’s life was so truly invaluable to
Burns that to lose her would leave a vacuum in his
enjoyments that nothing could fill up. By this time,
too, she was the mother of a daughter, born in England
in August, 1791. Her husband was again in
Dumfries, negotiating for an estate, and Maria had
gone to Edinburgh with the double purpose of seeking
expert medical advice and finding a printer for
her narrative of her voyage to the West Indies. To
this latter end Burns introduced her to his old friend
Smellie in a letter which paid the highest compliments
to her intellectual and literary accomplishments—if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
it can be called a high compliment to say
that her verses ‘always correct, and often elegant’,
were ‘very much beyond the common run of Lady
Poetesses of the day’. The introduction resulted in a
friendship between Smellie and Maria of which the
written records, being more decorous than Burns’s
own letters to the printer, were published by the latter’s
biographer. Maria liked to collect curios, and
her interest in Smellie might perhaps be thus explained.
But the gruff and erudite printer’s continued
interest in Maria is further evidence that she
had brains as well as charm, though her letters are
evidence enough.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1792 Walter Riddell purchased
the estate of Goldielea near Dumfries, renamed it
Woodley Park in Maria’s honour, and set up as a
country gentleman. More accurately, he paid a
small deposit on the purchase price without knowing
how he would raise the main sum. Burns visited
frequently at Woodley Park, though its master bored
him. Walter Riddell apparently shared his brother’s
convivial habits without his brother’s modicum of
literary and intellectual interests, and the poet’s attitude
towards him is more clearly shown by the
almost total absence of Walter’s name from his letters
to Walter’s wife than even by the crude epitaph
which described the man as empty-headed and
poisonous-hearted.</p>

<p>In letter-writing at least the friendship with
Maria reached perihelion in the autumn of 1793.
Walter was then in the West Indies, trying to raise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
money on his estate there, and Maria was living
alone at Woodley Park with her books, her music,
and two baby daughters. By this time Burns was
ponderously flirtatious. Maria was the first and
fairest of critics, the most amiable and most accomplished
of her sex, and it was the final proof of his
unhappy lot that when he was in love ‘Impossibility
presents an impervious barrier to the proudest daring
of Presumption, &amp; poor I dare much sooner
peep into the focus of Hell, than meet the eye of the
goddess of my soul!’ At least one impassioned lyric
which originally began ‘The last time I cam o’er the
moor And passed Maria’s dwelling’ had been composed
and submitted to the lady’s criticism accompanied
by a postscript which transparently disclaimed
personal application. In Walter’s absence,
many of their meetings during this autumn were at
the homes of mutual friends or at the little receptions
which Maria held between the acts in her box
at the theatre. These latter, however, were sometimes
subject to interruptions. On at least one occasion
Burns found an army officer—‘a lobster-coated
puppy’—already in possession, and withdrew without
even announcing himself. Maria chided him for
his failure to appear and invited him formally to
share her box at the next performance; he kept her
supplied with all his latest lyrics, including those
addressed to Clarinda.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to take Burns’s impassioned
avowals too seriously. Maria was a young and fascinating
woman of the type which pleases men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
better than it does members of her own sex, and Burns
thoroughly enjoyed her conversation. To the pleasures
of intellectual intercourse her company added
a subdued erotic stimulation which he expressed
in the only language he knew. The very frankness of
his remarks and Maria’s calm acceptance of them is
proof that they were neither meant nor taken literally.</p>

<p>And then came the breach seemingly inevitable in
Burns’s relations with every woman of higher station.
Its details are still obscure. Even its exact date
cannot be determined, though it must have been in
Christmas week of 1793. The traditional story is that
Burns was dining at Woodley Park and that the
men’s talk over their wine somehow got round to the
Rape of the Sabines. It was drunkenly agreed that
on returning to the drawing-room the men should
stage a burlesque of the episode. They did, and
Burns, singling out his hostess as his prey, put too
much ardour into the game. Mrs. Carswell interprets
the thing as a deliberate rag on the part of the
other men to get Burns to make a fool of himself.
Such at any rate was the result. After a stormy scene
during which some of the other ladies present tried
to intercede for the poet he was ignominiously expelled.
The next day he grovelled in contrition before
the offended lady in the painfully humiliating
‘letter from Hell’. She refused to be placated and
after two more abortive efforts on Burns’s part the
breach between them was complete.</p>

<p>This accepted story leaves unexplained several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
important details. Foremost among them is the fact
that in his apology Burns blames his host for constraining
him to drink more than he wished to.
Maria had told Smellie in November that Walter
Riddell was in the West Indies and was not expected
back until spring. On January 12th, when the
breach with Burns had already occurred, she again
mentioned her husband’s absence. If these letters
were correctly printed by Smellie’s biographer,
Walter Riddell could not have been the host; therefore
the scene could not have occurred at Woodley
Park. The alternative explanation is that it really
happened at Friars Carse, with Robert and Elizabeth
Riddell in the roles usually assigned to Walter
and Maria. In this case Maria, hearing of
Burns’s conduct, must have undertaken to discipline
him.</p>

<p>Whatever the circumstances, Burns’s subsequent
conduct was inexcusable. During the early spring
of 1794 he wrote several epigrams on Maria which
are utterly caddish, lacking alike in wit and decent
feeling. One of them he even offered to a London
newspaper, the editor of which had sense enough to
reject it. He also wrote the long, dull, and vulgar parody
of Pope which bears the title ‘Esopus to Maria’
and which attacks everything about Mrs. Riddell
from her hair to her morals. This last was meant for
the ‘quite private’ delectation of John Syme and one
or two other intimates, but even if Burns had published
it his conduct could not have appeared in
much worse light. The epigrams and the ‘Monody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
on a Lady Famed for Her Caprice’ are enough in
themselves to put it beyond condoning.</p>

<p>While Burns was thus exhibiting the worst side of
his nature, his victims’ circumstances were changing.
Walter Riddell had returned from the Indies
without the money he had gone to raise, and in the
course of the spring Woodley Park was repossessed
by its former owner, Walter forfeiting his £1000 deposit
on the purchase price as well as all that he had
laid out in improvements. On April 21st Robert
Riddell died, and Friars Carse was put on the market,
the relations between the two families being so
uncordial that Elizabeth Riddell refused any settlement
which would leave her brother-in-law in possession
of the estate. Walter and Maria attempted
the usual expedient of impoverished gentry—a prolonged
stay on the Continent—but found their way
barred by the armies of the French Revolution. Accordingly
after a few months in England they returned
to the neighbourhood of Dumfries to resume
life on a much reduced scale. They settled at Tinwald
House, a tumble-down estate near Lochmaben,
or rather Maria settled, for her husband was
absent most of the time. In May, 1795, they moved
again, this time to Halleaths, between Lochmaben
and Lockerbie, where they remained until they left
Scotland forever in 1797. How much Maria had
heard of Burns’s conduct towards her no one but
herself knew, and she never told. When Currie published
some of the letters referring to the quarrel she
affected complete ignorance of their relation to herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
though it is hard to believe that some kind friend
had not shown them to her.</p>

<p>If Burns showed the worst side of his nature in the
quarrel, Maria showed the best of hers in the reconciliation.
Early in 1795 she made the first move by
sending him a book she had heard he wished to read.
He replied in a formal note in the third person which
nevertheless welcomed the overture and opened the
way for further intercourse. By the beginning of May
he was writing in his old vein of flirtatious gaiety and
even confiding to Maria about the mysterious Reid
miniature of himself—mysterious because no one
knows for whom he had it painted, nor why. The
woman who quarrelled with Burns in 1794 may
have been capricious, and have pushed her rigour
further than was wise in dealing with a man of
Burns’s temperament. After all, twenty-one is not infallible
even when feminine and married. But the
woman who reinstated Burns in her good graces in
1795, after his caddish attacks upon her, was certainly
not petty.</p>

<p>The renewed friendship had not long to live.
Shadows of another sort soon began to fall across it,
for Burns’s health was breaking. A note written at
the end of May to accompany the loan of the Reid
miniature mentioned that he was so ill as scarcely to
be able to hold pen to paper; a month later he feared
that his health was gone forever. The autumn
brought further affliction in the death of his little
daughter, and it was to Maria that he uttered the
only existing record of his grief: ‘That you, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
friend, may never experience such a loss as mine,
sincerely prays R B.’</p>

<p>And so, through bereavement, illness, and despair,
the passionate, irritable poet and the vivacious
young woman of the world drew towards their
last meeting. The bleak little watering-place, the
Brow Well on the Solway, was the scene. Maria’s
health also was bad, and she evidently, like Burns,
lacked the funds to take her to a better resort. On
the 5th of July, 1796, she sent her carriage for
Burns: not until she saw him did she realize how
serious his condition was.</p>

<p>He was dying, and knew it. His overdriven heart,
which had never wholly recovered from the strain of
doing a man’s work on insufficient food at the age
of fourteen, was giving out, and he was hastening his
end according to the best medical advice in Dumfries.
A doctor who thought that angina was ‘flying
gout’ had ordered sea bathing, and the dying poet
was plunging himself daily in the chilly waters of the
Solway, as he had earlier in life sought to cure fainting-fits
in a tub of cold water at his bedside. Maria
was startled by the visible stamp of death on the features
of the emaciated man who tottered from her
carriage, and her concern was increased by his almost
total inability to eat. But the presence of a
young and attractive woman could still, as always,
rouse Burns to his best efforts, and his talk might
even have been gay—after his preliminary, ‘Well,
Madam, have you any messages for the other
world?’—had Maria been able to forget his haggard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
countenance long enough to reply in kind.</p>

<p>As it was, they had ‘a long and serious conversation
about his present situation, and the approaching
termination of all his earthly prospects.’ The
man who had never lied about himself, to himself or
others, now frankly faced the fact that he was dying.
And the presence of a sympathetic and intelligent
listener urged him on to speech about the matters
nearest his heart. Two things perturbed him on the
brink of the grave—anxiety for his family, and anxiety
for his fame. His eldest son was not yet ten;
there were three younger, and Jean was hourly expecting
a fifth; at least two others needed a father’s
help to lighten the stigma of illegitimacy. And as
for his literary reputation—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘He said he was well aware that his death would occasion
some noise, and that every scrap of his writing would
be revived against him to the injury of his future reputation:
that letters and verses written with unguarded and
improper freedom, and which he earnestly wished to have
buried in oblivion, would be handed about by idle vanity
or malevolence when no dread of his resentment would
restrain them or prevent the censures of shrill-tongued
malice or the insidious sarcasms of envy from pouring
forth all their venom to blast his fame.’</p>
</div>

<p>Could Burns have looked into the future, the prospect
would have deepened the pain in his harassed
soul. His anxiety for his family would have been
allayed, to be sure, but not even in his darkest hour
could he have visualized the future of his personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and literary fame. He foresaw attacks of his enemies;
he did not foresee the cowardice or treachery
of his friends. He need not have worried about his
trivial or unguarded writings, for time automatically
washes away the sand and leaves the gold, if
gold there be, and the publication of trifling letters
cannot harm their writer if the pattern of his soul
itself is not trifling. That spiritual descendants of
Holy Willie should deplore his best and strongest
work and shake their heads over passions of which
their impotent pulses were incapable, that enemies
eager for revenge and underlings eager for drink
should lie about their relations with him—these
things were to be expected. But that Bob Ainslie,
turned pious, should exemplify his own piety by
preserving and circulating Burns’s worst letters, that
George Thomson should not only ignore his dying
wishes but even, before his corpse was in the grave,
rush into print with a distorted and melodramatic
version of his last years which would set the tone
of biographies for a century to come, that Gilbert
should lack the courage to deny stories which he
knew to be false—all this, and much more, was mercifully
hidden from him. But it would have warmed
his heart to know that the one intimate friend who
would come before the world with a truthful account
of his character, extenuating nothing, and
setting nothing down in malice, was Maria Riddell,
on whom he had made unforgivable attacks, and
who nevertheless had forgiven him. The woman
with whom the dying poet talked that day until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
distant bulk of Criffel turned dark against the sunset,
and the chill tide in which he had been ordered to
bathe ebbed away from the dismal flats of the Solway,
was to prove herself the most devoted friend of
her sex he had ever had, Jean Armour always excepted.</p>

<p class="ph2">LIVELIHOOD</p>


<p>To Burns in the vigour of his early manhood the
question of livelihood seemed easily answered. He
was a good enough ploughman to be assured of the
porridge and the few shillings a week which a skilled
labourer could earn on a Scottish farm. There was
no degradation in such service. The labourers, like
the hired help on New England farms, ate with the
family and took whatever share in the conversation
they were capable of. Moreover, anyone, whatever
his rank, who was capable of ‘a sensible crack’ was
sure of welcome in households which had either to
provide their own entertainment or go without. Not
even the prospect of dependent old age held any
terrors. The tradition of the blue-gowns, or licensed
beggars, still persisted in rural Scotland. An old man
past work who could talk interestingly could count
on a meal and a place by the fire at almost any
farmer’s ingle. Burns seriously thought of this as a
possible end of his own life. The expression of the
idea in several poems might be dismissed as rhetoric
had he not repeated it in the sober prose of his letters.
He actually pictured himself as spending his
manhood in labour, love-making, and poetry and
his old age as a sort of Edie Ochiltree.</p>

<p>Such a vision of course was adolescent. To fulfil it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
a man must have no dependents. Burns seems to
have imagined at first that if he could help to keep
the home together until his brothers and sisters
were able to establish themselves his responsibilities
would end. The liberation of his poetic talent entailed
among other things a shrinking from the burdens
of marriage on narrow means. His rejected
proposal to Alison Begbie had come before his realization
of his poetic calling; his rejected offer to
Jean Armour in 1786 was the result of sympathy for
her condition and not of a desire to settle down. But
he soon learned that he could not so simply escape
responsibility. His children must be provided for
somehow even if he did not marry their mothers.
Despite the casualness with which he incurred paternity
his parental feelings were strong. ‘<i>Vive
l’amour et vive la bagatelle</i>’ sounded well as a motto
until it was confronted by the actual problem of
helpless lives which owed their existence to him.
As a Man of Feeling he could not, even had he
wished to, turn his back on them with Don Juan-like
callousness. Besides, the law might have something
to say in the matter—as Burns learned in the
course of four suits or threatened suits by four different
women within two years. Unless he chose to flee
the country and repudiate his obligations he had to
provide himself with settled livelihood.</p>

<p>For a man of his rank and education the possible
choices open in 1786 were limited. He could continue
as a farmer; he could attempt to support himself
by writing, or he could seek a salaried position at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
home or in the colonies. Each alternative had its
drawbacks. By the beginning of 1786 his reputation
in the community was such that he could scarcely
continue the partnership at Mossgiel, but he lacked
the capital necessary for setting up independently
elsewhere. The hope of any large financial returns
from his poetry seemed too fantastic for consideration;
he lacked the training for journalism or hackwork
when Grub Street was crowded with penniless
university men. There remained the chance of some
salaried position. Yet even if he had been temperamentally
fitted for a commercial job he was by this
time too old. Merchants’ clerks began their apprenticeship
as boys in their teens. Burns was twenty-seven.
A post in the Excise Service might be feasible
but was not easy to get. All government jobs went
by favour, and despite the unpopularity of the service
among the people at large the number of aspirants
so far exceeded the available places that the
endorsement of some influential person was almost
essential. The same thing was true of India, where
the East India Company’s monopoly gave patronage
as large a part as it had in the government services.
The United States, not yet united, were in
economic chaos; Canada was undeveloped. There
remained the West Indies, then at the height of a
prosperity built on slave labour, where independent
planters with Scottish connexions were numerous
enough to make it possible for a Scotsman with the
necessary introductions to secure some sort of work.
The story of Burns’s struggle for livelihood is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
story of his efforts in each of the four possibilities
open to him.</p>

<p>The West Indian venture was the only one which
never came to actual trial. The documents are lost
which would settle the date at which Burns began
seriously to consider emigration, but his mind was
made up at the very beginning of 1786. Through
friends in Ayrshire he obtained the offer of a position
at thirty pounds a year as clerk and overseer
on a Jamaica plantation. The story is still repeated
that he published the Kilmarnock <i>Poems</i> to pay his
passage-money, but his own contemporary account
of the matter is sufficient refutation. He had already
arranged to go to Jamaica, his employer to pay his
fare and deduct the sum from his first year’s salary,
before he decided to print the poems. For Burns
emigration was not only flight but almost a death
sentence. He had some justification for his feeling.
The West Indian climate helped to insure the financial
success of a small minority of white immigrants
by killing off most of their rivals. He published his
poems because he wished, before saying farewell
forever to Scotland, to leave behind some tangible
memorial. When the publication proved so unexpectedly
successful it immediately cancelled his
flight.</p>

<p>Burns’s first extant reference to Jamaica is in a
letter to John Arnot of Dalquhatswood, which was
written in April, 1786, when the subscription for the
<i>Poems</i> was well under way. Negotiations were then
almost complete: by June 12th Burns was able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
announce that the ship was on her way home that
was to take him out; on August 14th he explained
that he was entering the employ of Charles Douglas
of Port Antonio and all that remained to settle was
the route by which he was to travel. In view of the
time required for exchange of letters between Scotland
and the West Indies it is certain that the correspondence
with Douglas must have begun in the
winter, before the Kilmarnock volume was planned
and while a considerable part of it was still unwritten.
As the troubles with the Armours thickened
during the summer so did Burns’s references to his
impending emigration. During July and the first
part of August he was announcing that he had
booked passage from Greenock to Savannah-la-Mar
in the <i>Nancy</i>, sailing about September 1. Then returned
Jamaicans advised him that the route was
too roundabout, and when the captain of the <i>Nancy</i>
notified him that the ship was about to sail, Burns
decided that the notice was too abrupt. The <i>Nancy</i>
sailed without him, and he transferred his booking
to the <i>Bell</i>, which was to sail direct to Port Antonio
at the end of September.</p>

<p>The truth was that he was already wavering. The
enthusiastic reception of his poems, the interest
which influential gentlemen began to take in his
welfare, were changing his opinion of himself and
his prospects in Scotland. Moreover, the Armours
were calming down; friends had promised to help
him should Jean’s father renew the effort to execute
his warrant. Nevertheless he did not immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
abandon the Jamaica plan. Though the <i>Bell</i> in her
turn sailed without him, he still watched the shipping
news as he collected his subscriptions and set
his affairs in order. Jean’s twins, born on September
3rd, increased the need for settled livelihood, but
increased also his reluctance to leave Scotland.</p>

<p>Most of his letters of the autumn of 1786 have
perished. As late as October he was still talking of
emigration, though he had again postponed it after
actually packing his trunk and starting for Greenock
at the end of September. He still feared, he told
Robert Aiken, that ‘the consequences of his follies’
might banish him; in other words, Betty Paton was
threatening to sue him. The Armour affair had already
been compromised by dividing the responsibility
for the care of the twins between the two families.
When the extant correspondence resumes a
month later, Jamaica had been discarded. By
November 1st the poet had decided to try his luck
in Edinburgh. For this reversal the Kilmarnock
volume was directly responsible.</p>

<p>When Burns had begun in April to solicit subscriptions
for a volume of his poems he had had no
idea of making it a commercial success. The book
was intended as a memento of himself—a souvenir
for his friends and a final and unanswerable fling at
his enemies. He probably hoped for no more material
return than would cover the expenses of publication.
Its success therefore was all the more intoxicating.
Six hundred and twelve copies were printed, of
which about half were subscribed for in advance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
thanks mainly to Robert Aiken. When the book
came out at the beginning of August it furnished the
first literary sensation Ayrshire had ever known.
The subscribers’ copies were passed from reader to
reader, creating such a demand that the entire edition
was sold within three months. When Mrs. Dunlop
ordered six copies in mid-November only five
were left. At the end of July Burns had been a fugitive
with a warrant out against him, to escape which
he was shifting from one friend’s house to another.
Two weeks later he was a celebrity. His journeys
through the country as he collected his subscriptions
became a sort of royal progress. The fact that he was
making a profit out of the book meant far less to him
than the applause of all sorts and conditions of men.
People of influence assured him that something
could be done for him at home, though they were
vague as to precisely what. After the printer’s bills
were paid the volume showed a profit of more than
£50, though forfeited deposits on passage money
and a substantial payment to Betty Paton reduced
his net gain to about twenty. But Burns still had no
wish to write poetry for money. He considered that
‘downright Sodomy of Soul’. Poetry was his calling,
but he refused to think of it as his livelihood.</p>

<p>Another man for other reasons doubted the commercial
prospects of poetry. In spite of the handsome
balance-sheet of the first edition, John Wilson, the
Kilmarnock printer, declined to undertake a second
without advance payment for all labour and materials.
He felt that the first had glutted the market.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
His timidity helped to transform Burns from a local
celebrity into a national figure. When friends
in Mauchline and Ayr suggested republishing the
poems in Edinburgh Burns thought it an attractive
but impractical dream. But when copies of the book
reached people of influence in the capital and they
repeated the suggestion it wore a different look. By
October the hope of a favourable reception in the
city had come to Burns from at least three different
sources. His friend, the Rev. George Lawrie of Loudoun,
had sent a copy of the book to Thomas Blacklock,
the blind poet; Blacklock had commended it
warmly and had even promised—not so warmly—to
bring it to the attention of Hugh Blair. The famous
professor of rhetoric, Blacklock thought, was
too refined in his taste to relish it. Another eminent
professor was not so finicky. Dugald Stewart, whose
country home was at Catrine a few miles from
Mauchline, read and enjoyed the poems, invited the
poet to dinner, and added his personal encouragement
to the Edinburgh venture. Finally the book
reached even the peerage.</p>

<p>On November 1st Alexander Dalziel, steward of
the Earl of Glencairn’s estates, wrote that he had
showed the poems to the Earl and that the Earl had
expressed his pleasure in them and his desire to befriend
their author. This approbation was heartening
as Blacklock’s and even Dugald Stewart’s could
not be. The Earl had a reputation for generosity and
for keeping his word; he was one of the most popular
and influential peers in Scotland and his endorsement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
would have weight with the people of wealth
and fashion on whom the success of a subscription
would have to depend. But the Earl had nothing to
do with the abandonment of Jamaica. The same
letter which brought the news of the Earl’s interest
also brought Dalziel’s congratulations on Burns’s
giving up his plans for leaving the country. What
Glencairn really did was to confirm the poet in his
determination to offer his poems to a larger audience.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Burns realized before he went to
Edinburgh that he was setting out on the old and
painful quest of patronage—a quest which had
broken the hearts of more poets than it had ever
freed from penury. But it was still fame more than
money that he looked for from his poems. He continued
to hope for some means of modest livelihood
independent of his writing; if his subscription
brought a little capital to help him on his way, so
much the better. When he reached Edinburgh he
made no effort to appear more than he was; he even
sought deliberately to appear less. He dressed as a
plain young farmer, and finding that the metropolitan
critics were praising his work as that of an unlettered
ploughman who wrote from pure inspiration
he did his best to act the part. When Robert
Anderson pointed out in private conversation some
evidence of extensive knowledge of other poets
Burns readily admitted his indebtedness, but in public
he would not permit his claims to pure inspiration
to be challenged. If an unlettered bard was what his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
patrons wanted he would do his best to be one.
Many times, however, his role was trying, especially
when stupider people than himself condescended,
and gave him good advice.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there were matters in which he
needed good advice, but he did not get it even from
the patrons who did not condescend. Among all his
new friends there was no one to take his part as Sir
Walter Scott later took Southey’s in seeing that he
got a fair contract with his publisher. Glencairn had
been as good as his word in securing fashionable
subscriptions. The Countess of Eglinton made the
Earl subscribe ten guineas; the entire membership
of the aristocratic Caledonian Hunt put down their
names, but altered the first proposal that they give
two guineas each to a mere subscription at the regular
price. But Glencairn knew nothing about the
business end of publishing. In introducing Burns to
William Creech, his brother’s former tutor and the
best-known publisher in the city, Glencairn no
doubt felt that he had done his best. He had, up to
that point, but at that point a good contract lawyer
was needed. Unfortunately Henry Mackenzie and
the other men of letters in the city still adhered to
the convention of the writing gentleman who was
supposed to disdain pecuniary rewards. A few years
earlier, when David Hume was alive, Burns might
have been secured better terms; a few years later
under the leadership of Scott he would certainly
have secured them. Burns’s perverse pride would not
allow him to haggle over a contract which in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
case offered more ready money than he had handled
in all his previous life. What he needed and did not
have was a hard-boiled business friend to do his
haggling for him.</p>

<p>As it was, Creech made an agreement which left
Burns to bear all the immediate risks and perhaps
to receive a modest immediate profit, but which reserved
the long-term earnings for the publisher
alone. As was often the case with books published by
subscription, the man whose name appeared on the
title-page was not the publisher in the modern sense,
but merely the author’s agent. He provided the
facilities for collecting the subscriptions and distributing
the books, but took none of the financial
responsibility. The author received the entire payment
for the subscribers’ copies, but out of these
receipts had to pay the printer, the bookbinder, and
also, presumably, the transportation charges on
copies delivered out-of-town. Furthermore, the
agents who distributed the books naturally expected
to be paid. Hence Burns, wherever possible,
enlisted his friends for this service—Alexander Pattison
at Paisley, for instance, and Robert Muir at
Kilmarnock—and when that was not feasible still
sought to avoid the regular booksellers because they
took ‘no less than the unconscionable, Jewish tax
of 25 p<sup>r</sup> Cent. by way of agency’.</p>

<p>The price to subscribers was set at the modest sum
of five shillings, and close to three thousand subscriptions
were obtained. Burns objected to printing
the names of the subscribers—quite naturally, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
the thirty-eight pages meant money out of his
pocket merely to gratify the vanity of people yearning
to see their names in print as patrons of literature—but
was overborne by some friends whom he
did not ‘chuse to thwart’. Professor Snyder calculates
Burns’s utmost possible gross receipts from the
subscription at £750. But after all charges were paid
the net profit cannot have been more than half that
sum. He told Mrs. Dunlop that he cleared about
£540, but there, as in a similar statement to John
Moore, he was reckoning in Creech’s payment of
100 guineas for the copyright.</p>

<p>That was the sum agreed on when, just as his
book was ready for delivery, Burns decided, ‘by
advice of friends’ to dispose of his copyright. Once
more he had sought the advice of others, and once
more they told him the wrong thing. In this instance,
the person most at fault was Henry Mackenzie,
to whom Burns and Creech referred the question.
Mackenzie was a lawyer, and ought to have
warned Burns against the absolute sale of his rights
in a potentially valuable piece of property. Instead
Mackenzie contented himself with naming one
hundred guineas as his idea of a fair price. That was
on April 17. Creech delayed his acceptance until the
23rd, on the pretence of waiting to hear if Cadell and
Davies would buy a share for their London trade,
but finally consented to ‘take the whole matter
upon himself, that Mr. Burns might be at no uncertainty
in the matter.’ Thereupon Creech left town,
without either paying the money or giving his note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
for it. A few days later Burns himself started on his
Border tour, still without any legal contract with
Creech, but with his hands full for the time being
with the task of arranging deliveries, collecting subscriptions,
and paying the printer and the binder.
Had not Peter Hill, then Creech’s chief clerk, taken
a good part of the burden on himself, Burns would
have been swamped under the worry of larger transactions
than he had known in all his life before.</p>

<p>In August Burns returned to Edinburgh, but
Creech was either again absent or again coy. Not
until October 23 did the publisher at last set his
hand to a note promising to pay the sum ‘on demand’.
How soon Burns began to ask for payment is
uncertain, but by January Creech had delayed and
evaded so often that Burns ‘broke measures with
[him], and ... wrote him a frosty keen letter. He
replied in forms of chastisement’, promised payment
on a set date—and broke his promise. To add
to the poet’s anxiety, rumours were afloat. It was
hinted that Creech was on the verge of bankruptcy;
it was also hinted that he had cheated Burns by secretly
printing additional copies of the <i>Poems</i>, which
he sold for his own profit. Burns bewailed his own
fate as a ‘poor, d-mned, incautious, duped, unfortunate
fool’; two months later ‘that arch-rascal
Creech’ was still making promises, and still reneguing.
Not until May 30, more than seven months
after he had agreed to pay ‘on demand’, did Creech
at last part with his hundred guineas. And even then
Burns’s troubles were not over. Still another visit to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Edinburgh, at the end of February, 1789, was necessary
before Creech paid over the final sums due
the poet for subscription copies, so that at last he
could report to Jean: ‘I have settled matters greatly
to my satisfaction with Mr. Creech.—He is certainly
not what he should be nor has he given me
what I should have, but I am better than I
expected.’</p>

<p>The estimate of Creech was temperate enough;
indeed, it erred, like Burns’s statement to John
Moore that Creech had ‘been amicable and fair’
with him, on the side of charity. It is easy to condone
Mackenzie’s blunder and Creech’s sharp bargain on
the ground that neither of them could guess the future
value of the copyright, but it is impossible to
excuse Creech’s postponements of the day of reckoning.
Prompt settlement of accounts after the book
was published would have sent Burns back to the
country with his pockets comfortably lined and with
some of the glowing enthusiasm of his first season in
Edinburgh still undimmed. By his paltry delays
Creech kept the poet in the city until the interest of
his fashionable ‘patrons’ had waned, until all the
pleasure of publication and fame had evaporated in
bitterness and disgust, and until the mere necessities
of living must have made considerable inroads on
his irreplaceable capital.</p>

<p>Indeed one of the extraordinary facts about
Burns’s life in Edinburgh is that he emerged from it
without greater depletion of his capital. Contemporary
report calls him dissipated. Yet somehow Burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
managed to spend nearly a year and a half either in
residence in Edinburgh or in journeying to and fro,
and still came out with about four hundred and
fifty pounds. So far as is known he had no income
from July, 1786, when he assigned his rights in Mossgiel
to Gilbert, until he reaped his harvest, such as
it was, at Ellisland in the autumn of 1788. Even
then he netted little, for the outgoing tenant exacted
a price of £72 for the standing crops. However great
his experience in the distracting ‘task of the superlatively
Damn’d—making one guinea do the business
of three’—his twenty pounds from the Kilmarnock
volume cannot have lasted long, and if there were
any gifts except the Earl of Eglinton’s ten guineas
and the same sum from Patrick Miller he nowhere
mentions them. If Burns dissipated heavily he managed
somehow to do it without heavy expenditure,
an art few people have ever learned.</p>

<p>The possibility that he received funds from Gilbert
even after the deed of assignment must be ruled
out. The flow of funds in fact was the other way. The
supposedly careful and efficient Gilbert was in constant
difficulties at Mossgiel. Robert sent him ten
pounds from Edinburgh in the spring of 1787; during
the following winter he authorized John Ballantine
to pay over to Gilbert about thirty pounds of
subscription money then in Ballantine’s hands. And
this was only the beginning. The letter to Gavin
Hamilton already quoted indicates that Gilbert
was so far in arrears with his rent in March, 1788,
that Hamilton wanted Burns to sign some sort of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
note for him. This Burns refused to do, because he
had already lent Gilbert £200—nearly half his receipts
from the Edinburgh edition. Whether the
previous payments were counted as part of this loan
or not is uncertain; probably they were not, for after
the poet’s death John Syme declared that Gilbert
owed £300, though the legal accounting sets the
figure at £200. It seems likely therefore that Gilbert
regarded the earlier payments as gifts, and that the
sum which Gilbert at last repaid to his brother’s
family represented the final loan in 1788. As part of
the interest on the loan Burns arranged that Gilbert
should pay his mother an annuity of £5 a year and
should continue to care for Betty Paton’s daughter.
The result was that Gilbert made no cash payment
during Burns’s life, and never was able to pay off the
principal until he undertook to re-edit the <i>Poems</i> in
1820. Burns had given most substantial proof of his
loyalty to his family and in doing so had destroyed
his only hope of success in his own venture at Ellisland.</p>

<p>Gilbert and his mother and sisters were not
the whole of Burns’s responsibilities. His younger
brother William was approaching manhood and
turned naturally for support to the celebrity of the
family. He appears to have been an amiable but ineffective
youth. He had served at least part of an
apprenticeship as a saddler, and in the autumn of
1787 Burns made some fruitless efforts to find him a
job in Edinburgh. A year or so later William set out
to look for employment and held jobs briefly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
Longtown, in Newcastle, and finally in London,
where he died of typhus and where his funeral was
arranged by John Murdoch and paid for by Burns.
Burns’s letters to this brother during his year of wandering
consist in about equal proportion of exhortations
to brace up and be a man and of enumerations
of gifts—shoes and shirts and waistcoats and above
all money. Burns’s position as family capitalist was
no sinecure.</p>

<p>While he was struggling with Creech and trying
to keep Mossgiel afloat, Burns was constantly harried
by the problem of his own future. The only two
possibilities he could see were a farm of his own or
a post in the Excise, and for a long time there seemed
little chance of achieving either. He had no intention
of trying again for public aid through his writing.
One subscription might be regarded as a public
tribute; a repetition would look like begging. Besides,
his common sense told him that a second subscription
would have little hope of success unless it
came at a long interval after the first and for work
of a different character. He had not exhausted his
talents, but he had exhausted his novelty. For the
rest of his life he steadfastly refused to accept payment
for anything he wrote and actually gave away
poems which make up two-thirds of the bulk of his
collected works. His sole payment for ‘Tam o’ Shanter’
was a dozen copies of the proof-sheets; his payment
for Creech’s second edition in 1793—which
included ‘Tam’ and a score of other new poems—was
twenty presentation copies grudgingly allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
him. His fondness for making gestures of gallant
but unwise generosity can hardly be better illustrated
than by his dealings with Creech over this
edition. The publisher wrote to him in 1791, proposing
a reissue of the work and asking Burns to contribute
some new poems to it, but without suggesting
payment for them. Burns told Cunningham that
he had taken a damned revenge of Creech by ignoring
his letter. Yet a few months later he relented,
and after reminding Creech that the new poems
were his own absolute property, turned them over
to him without asking any payment except the
twenty gift copies. Such a gesture might have
shamed some publishers, but Creech merely accepted
it as his right. In the same spirit Burns hotly
resented George Thomson’s payment of £5 for his
contributions to the first number of the <i>Select Scotish
Airs</i>, and Thomson, like Creech, felt no compunction
at accepting the poet’s quixotic generosity.</p>

<p>On at least two occasions, moreover, Burns was
offered pay for journalistic writing in party newspapers.
The origin, extent, and duration of his relations
with Peter Stuart of the London <i>Star</i> are all
obscure, but it is plain that Stuart as a zealous Whig
tried to get Burns as a regular contributor. The poet
refused. When he struck off a satirical skit he was
willing to give it to Stuart, but the only pay he accepted
was a free subscription to the paper. Thus he
managed to acquire the reputation, injurious to his
hopes in government employ, of being a partisan
writer without any reward except notoriety. Again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
in 1794 Patrick Miller, Jr., his landlord’s son who
had been put into Parliament at the age of twenty-one,
persuaded James Perry of the London <i>Chronicle</i>
to offer Burns what for those days was a fair salary
if he would come to London and devote his talents
to the press. Again Burns refused. He realized
well enough that the prosperity of a newspaper was
often short-lived and he feared to jeopardize his
children’s future by exchanging an assured though
meagre income for the chances of the journalistic
profession. Besides, the writer in a partisan paper in
1794 was risking jail as well as economic insecurity,
as the sedition trials then in progress had proclaimed
to all the kingdom.</p>

<p>But if he was not to support himself by writing
how was he to support himself? That question hammered
in his mind from the time he abandoned the
Jamaica project until the early spring of 1788. Even
before he went to Edinburgh he had thought of the
Excise. But he found his Edinburgh patrons cold to
all hints. These gentlemen reasoned simply. Burns
was the ploughman poet: ergo, he should continue
to plough. The only definite gesture made towards
getting him government work was Mrs. Dunlop’s.
She offered an introduction to Adam Smith in the
hope that Smith might help him to a job in the customs,
but the philosopher had left for London the
day before Burns presented his letter. Moreover
Smith no longer took an interest in much except his
own health, and if Burns sought later to renew his
application nothing came of it. His most favourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
opportunity to cultivate the acquaintance of high
officials was lost when he allowed William Nicol to
drag him away from Blair Athole, where Robert
Graham of Fintry, Commissioner of Excise, was one
of the guests, and where Henry Dundas was shortly
to appear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile an offer of another sort was being
pressed upon him. He had been in Edinburgh only
a few weeks when the prosperous and enthusiastic
Patrick Miller sought his acquaintance. Miller, after
a varied career, at sea and as a banker, had retired
from business with a comfortable fortune and was
devoting himself to miscellaneous experiments. He
was the sort of capitalist who is a godsend to struggling
inventors, for his enthusiastic imagination
enabled him both to visualize the inventor’s aims
and to overlook all the practical details and delays
which intervene between a project and its fulfilment.
His strongest enthusiasm at the moment was the
improvement of navigation, but his interests also included
agriculture. Not long before Burns came to
Edinburgh Miller had bought the run-down estate
of Dalswinton near Dumfries, and it was Ellisland,
one of the farms on this estate, which he urged
upon Burns.</p>

<p>The poet was afraid of it from the start, and for
good reason. Miller, he said, was no judge of land,
and what Miller thought was an advantageous offer
might ruin his tenant. Had Burns been gifted with
second-sight he could not have prophesied more
accurately. Yet the difficulty he always found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
saying ‘No’ to people whose intentions were friendly
combined with his own inclinations to keep him
from refusing Miller’s offer outright. Farming was
the business he knew best, and a farmer’s life he held
was the best of lives—if one could live by it—but
Mount Oliphant, Lochlie, and Mossgiel had been
a triple lesson on the fate of the tenant who undertook
a lease without capital enough to stock a farm
profitably. Even if the Dalswinton farm were all
that Miller thought it, Burns doubted if his literary
profits would suffice to give him a start. However,
he agreed to look at Ellisland when he reached
Dumfries at the end of his Border tour. When he
did so he could scarcely have been in the mood for
a really critical examination. The savage hospitality
he had experienced for the past three weeks had
left him jaded and depressed, and the annoyance of
being greeted at Dumfries by Meg Cameron’s letter
would not sharpen his critical faculties. Even so he
could see at a glance that the soil was exhausted and
would require long and careful nursing. In fact the
only thing to be said for Miller’s offer was that,
recognizing the run-down condition of the property,
he was offering it at a low rental for the first three
years. Fifty pounds per annum for a farm of more
than a hundred acres contrasted favourably with the
prices in East Lothian, where landlords were asking
as much as thirty shillings an acre. Burns went home
to Mossgiel without having made up his mind; if
discussion with the cautious Gilbert contributed to
any decision it was a negative one. Ellisland was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
too big a risk. He returned to Edinburgh in the fall
with his mind made up. He would renew his efforts
to secure an Excise commission and would bank the
profits of his poems as a reserve fund for the education
and security of his children.</p>

<p>But Miller was not easily discouraged. He had
evidently decided that the poet as a tenant would
be an asset to Dalswinton. Accordingly he urged
Burns to go down again and have a more critical
look at the place. A severe cold which confined him
to the house enabled Burns again to evade committing
himself and not long afterwards came the
injury to his knee which laid him up for weeks and
involved him in the Clarinda affair. But meanwhile
his endeavours for an Excise commission were not
prospering. Glencairn disapproved; Mrs. Dunlop
disapproved; apparently everyone who might have
exerted the necessary influence disapproved. In
January Miss Nimmo sent him to a Mrs. Stewart
who was supposed to have influence with the commissioners.
The interview was not a success. Burns
came away from it boiling with helpless rage. He
had been questioned like a child about his most
private affairs and Mrs. Stewart had further improved
the occasion by rebuking him for the Jacobite
sentiments he had scratched on the window of
the inn at Stirling. If the quest for an Excise job
was to expose him to this sort of thing Burns was
ready to throw up the whole project.</p>

<p>Just when the matter appeared most hopeless
his chance came from an unexpected quarter. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
surgeon who had treated his injured knee was Alexander
Wood, better known to his fellow-citizens as
Lang Sandy Wood, who after a wild youth had
become one of the most respectable characters, in
both senses of that word, in Edinburgh. Wood
learned of his patient’s desire and offered to do what
Glencairn and the others had refused or evaded—to
bring Burns’s case directly and personally before
the Board. The result was that before he left Edinburgh
Burns found himself, ‘without any mortifying
solicitation’ on his own part, equipped with the
official order for the six-weeks’ course of special instructions
which would entitle him to an Excise
commission. It came none too soon. One of the
rules of the service was that no man could enter it
who was in debt, who was more than thirty years
old, or who had more than three children. Burns’s
time for meeting these two latter qualifications was
getting very short indeed.</p>

<p>But now that he saw an open road into the Excise
Burns’s mind veered round. Farming after all was a
more poetical occupation than ‘searching auld
wives’ barrels’. Miller was still urging Ellisland upon
him, and the possibility of failure there did not
look so black when he knew that if he did fail he
had the Excise to turn to. He agreed to revisit the
farm. No doubt he told himself, as he told Clarinda,
that he did so only out of courtesy to Miller, knowing
that the Excise must be his lot. His judgement
warned him that the farm would not do; his emotions
swayed him in its favour. In an effort to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
strengthen his judgement he invited his old friend,
John Tennant of Glenconner, to join the tour of
inspection. Glenconner’s mind would not be biased
by any poetic considerations. It did not occur to
Burns that even the most experienced of farmers,
looking at soil different from that he was accustomed
to, could scarcely gauge its productivity
rightly at the end of February. The rule-of-thumb
farming which Glenconner and most of his contemporaries
practised required the sight of growing
crops for correct judgement. Tennant looked the
place over and told Burns it was a bargain at Miller’s
price. The opinion astonished the poet, but he failed
to realize that it was merely a guess less accurate
than the opinion he himself had formed on seeing
the place the previous June. Burns frequently made
mistakes, but his worst ones were made when he
relied on other people’s judgement. In March he
signed Miller’s lease and committed himself to three
years of struggle and discouragement which swallowed
all the capital which had not already been
poured into the bottomless morass of Mossgiel.</p>

<p>Legend has it that Burns was offered his choice of
two farms on the Dalswinton estate and selected
Ellisland because of its more attractive location—‘a
poet’s choice and not a farmer’s’. In fact Miller
offered no choice, and in drawing up the lease employed
all the usual legal technicalities with one or
two additions of his own. The rent was to be £50
a year for the first three years and £70 thereafter,
and Miller’s zeal for improvements was to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
scope even while the tenant was in possession. The
landlord reserved the right to take over the riverbank,
a twenty-yard-wide belt along the Friars
Carse boundary, and two acres of other land at his
own choice to plant with trees. He agreed, however,
to put money of his own into the place. It had not
even a farmhouse when Burns signed the lease, and
Miller undertook to provide adequate buildings.
The contractor’s delay in constructing these caused
further needless anxiety and actual loss to Burns.</p>

<p>After the die was cast all Burns’s earlier doubts
about Ellisland and his own ability to handle it
returned with redoubled force. His first move was
to make sure of his Excise appointment by taking
the necessary six weeks of special instructions from
the officer at Mauchline, even though this delayed
his settlement until mid-June. Inasmuch as these six
weeks included also the emotional stress of the ending
of the Clarinda romance and his acknowledgement
of Jean as his wife, his nerves were overwrought
when he finally reached his farm. The
prospect there might have discouraged a more
phlegmatic man. The farmhouse was not even
started, and his only shelter was a leaky and chimneyless
labourer’s hovel. The sparse growth of the
crops planted by his predecessor confirmed the exhaustion
of the soil, and he was confronted as never
before with the need for executive skill. That aspect
of his nature which led him to remark that somehow
he could make himself pretty generally beloved
yet never could get the art of commanding respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
told heavily against him when he had both to keep
his own labourers at work and to bully or cajole the
contractor into finishing the farmhouse at the time
agreed upon. When he was not present the farmhands
lay down on the job; when he was present
they found it altogether too easy to engage him
in talk while the work suffered. The friendship
he formed with Thomas Boyd, the contractor, led
among other things to an acquaintance with
Thomas Telford, the great engineer, but it did not
lead to the speedy completion of his house. As late
as March, 1789, he was still pleading with Boyd to
get at least the shell of it finished. Moreover he was
too sympathetic with his workmen. The margin of
profit on such a farm was too small to permit indulgence
in humanitarian sentiments, but Burns knew
too much of the lives of the lower classes to have
the necessary hardness. Two letters to the owner of
the neighbouring farm with whom Burns had cooperated
in digging a drain do credit to his feelings
if not to his business capacity. The labourer who
undertook the job at seventeen pence a rood had
underestimated the time. In order to give him a
fair wage for his labour Burns added three-pence a
rood to the contract price for his share and asked
the neighbour to do the same—with what result is
not recorded.</p>

<p>But there was a still deeper psychological hindrance
to success at Ellisland. Even had the soil
been productive, even had he secured a foreman
who could have kept his hands at work, the Burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
who undertook Ellisland was not the Burns of
Lochlie or even of Mossgiel. Though by no means
setting up as a gentleman farmer, he had become
conscious of having a position to maintain. Gilbert,
he thought, might be able to take over Ellisland and
succeed with it; ‘as he can with propriety do things
that I <i>now</i> cannot do.’ Physical debility was also
to be reckoned with, for he must have got out of
training during almost two years of exemption from
regular labour, and his weakened heart would prevent
his easily recovering his lost tone. But in fact
his mind was filled with other matters and metres.
That during his first summer he spent alternate
fortnights with Jean in Mauchline was a temporary
circumstance without relation to the success of the
farm thereafter, but that his work for Johnson’s
<i>Museum</i> was filling his mind was a fact less easily
discounted. In the middle of his first summer he had
a fiddler with him for at least two days playing
over a collection of Highland music in quest of lyric
tunes for Johnson. It was a prelude to his greatest
period of lyric creativeness, but it was not an augury
of success in managing a poor farm on limited
capital.</p>

<p>The first season’s harvest offered little encouragement.
Wet weather and scanty labour made it difficult
to salvage whatever thin crop the fields had
produced. Before his lease was six months old Burns
was confiding to his friends that he was uncertain
of his farm’s doing well, but, as he told Ainslie, he
had his Excise commission in his pocket and did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
care three skips of a cur dog for the gambols of
Fortune. The chance of obtaining the commission
had made him willing to undertake the farm; possession
added still another psychological handicap
to its successful conduct. Embittered youthful memories
of the humiliations of a tenant farmer had been
reinforced by the development of his poetic vocation
to clog whole-hearted effort. Now the existence
of his commission held always open a door of escape
from any threatened renewal of the old humiliation
and thereby unconsciously slowed still further the
endeavours which were his only safeguard. He was
defeated at Ellisland before he began.</p>

<p>By the following spring he had begun to realize
his defeat. The farm and his family, including William,
were swallowing the remains of his capital so
rapidly that it was doubtful if he could hold on
without more income than the farm was likely to
yield. It occurred to him that he might use his
commission while he still held the farm. He had not
thought of this at first. The usual procedure for a
beginner was to be assigned to some district where
a place was vacant, there to serve several months’
apprenticeship without pay. When pay commenced,
it had until recently been at the rate of £35 a year,
but about the time Burns obtained his commission
the initial stipend was raised to £50. Looking about
his own neighbourhood, Burns learned that the
officer in charge of the rural parishes to the north
of Dumfries was a certain Leonard Smith, who had
recently inherited money and was not distinguishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
himself by activity in the service. Burns decided to
play politics.</p>

<p>His commission had been obtained through
Robert Graham of Fintry, one of the chief Commissioners
for Scotland. Fintry had expressed personal
interest in the poet’s welfare in terms which must
have soothed his bristling pride, for Burns had already
addressed to him both a prose letter of thanks
and a poetic epistle in imitation of Pope. Though
Fintry never quite supplanted Lord Glencairn in
Burns’s esteem, he in fact became the poet’s second
patron and in the long run did more for him than
even the Earl had done. Graham’s first favour had
been the commission itself; his second was the appointment
to active duty. Before his first harvest
was over Burns coolly suggested that Smith might
be relieved from duty without serious loss to himself
and perhaps with a gain to the Service. On his visit
to Edinburgh in February, 1789, Burns pressed the
matter further. Graham promised to do what he
could, but pointed out that it was clean against
regulations to start a new man at full pay without a
probationary period. Nevertheless he undertook to
investigate Smith’s conduct and by midsummer had
found cause for removing him, had given Burns the
place, and had circumvented the rule against starting
a new man at full duty and on full pay. For one
who had always boasted his independence and had
spoken scornfully of the political quest for favours,
Burns had done a neat and successful job of wire-pulling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>Having once got his appointment, however, Burns
had no intention of treating it as a sinecure. His district
covered twelve sparsely-settled parishes and his
tours of inspection required, to fulfil the letter of the
law, that he ride two hundred miles a week in all
weathers and all states of the uniformly bad roads.
This meant that he could give little of his time and
less of his strength to Ellisland. To provide for the
farm he endeavoured to increase his dairy stock,
which Jean could supervise in the intervals of having
babies and managing her household. The cattle,
too, might help in the slow task of rebuilding the
worn-out acres.</p>

<p>But the strain of his new duties soon took physical
toll. In the late fall of 1789, after less than two
months of service, ‘a malignant squinancy and low
fever’ laid him up for six weeks. His handwriting
indicates that the illness was really serious; the letters
written during convalescence are in a hand almost
as weak and straggling as that of June and
July, 1796. Nevertheless he had proved his qualifications
for the job. An official report on various
subordinate officers in the Excise bears after Burns’s
name the notation ‘a poet—never tried—turns out
well.’ He had moreover established friendly relations
with his immediate superiors, Alexander Findlater,
the Supervisor, and John Mitchell, the Collector, of
the Dumfries district. With the latter, indeed, he
was already on terms approaching intimacy, sending
him gifts of new-laid eggs from Ellisland and
accompanying them at least once with a poetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
epistle so broadly humorous that no editor has ever
printed it all. Both men testified to Burns’s fidelity
by defending his character after his death and—what
is far more significant—by reporting favourably
on him during his life.</p>

<p>He was giving reason for favourable reports. His
predecessor had been so slack that Burns was able
to appear, at the first session of court after he began
duty, with an impressive array of cases of tax evasion.
In handling these he again displayed political
astuteness. The minor offenders, mostly poor men
who could ill afford a fine, he begged off with warnings
or suspended sentences. This almost compelled
the magistrates to fine the larger offenders for whom
he refused to intercede, and inasmuch as Excise
officers then, like American customs inspectors today,
received a percentage of these penalties, Burns
found his procedure remunerative in cash as well as
in official credit. He soon discovered, though, that
zeal had its drawbacks. Gentlemen of position, including
some of the magistrates themselves, had
their favourite smugglers or home-brewers, and
when Burns caught one of these he started all the
machinery of influence and political pressure so
familiar to Americans during the prohibition era.
Once he told Collector Mitchell, after a hard day’s
riding in rounding up witnesses in a case, that he
expected for his pains to be clapped in jail for annoying
the friends of half the gentlemen in the
county. The grosser temptations of bribery, however,
did not touch him. The various legends, deriving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
from highly unreliable oral tradition, of his
leniency with small offenders mean no more, even
if literally true, than that Burns had learned the
common sense of his profession. A customs inspector
knows that his job is not to penalize every
tourist who has failed to declare a dozen handkerchiefs
but to catch the large-scale smuggler. The
same was true of the laws Burns had to enforce,
which imposed taxes on everything from whisky to
candles. Not but what he made ordinary human
distinctions between his public and his private capacities.
William Lorimer, father of ‘Chloris’, was
one of the poet’s intimate friends. He was also a
bootlegger whose ways were, ‘like the grace of G—,
past all comprehension’. Seemingly Lorimer maintained
a moderate legal stock for inspection purposes,
but once when he was absent and his wife
drunk something slipped in the working of the
gentlemen’s agreement, and Burns had to explain
to Supervisor Findlater. Another time he helped,
as revenue officer, in a series of raids on Dumfries
haberdashers who had been selling smuggled French
gloves. A few days later, as private citizen, he supplied
Maria Riddell with similar gloves from a still
unraided dealer’s stock. The problems and conditions
of law enforcement are among the few immutables
in human history.</p>

<p>After two years’ experience Burns reaffirmed that
the Excise was after all the business for him. He
added, ‘I find no difficulty in being an honest man
in it; the work of itself, is easy; and it is a devilish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
different affair, managing money matters where I
care not a damn whether the money is paid or not;
from the long faces made to a haughty Laird or still
more haughty Factor, when rents are demanded,
and money, alas, not to be had!’ His position as
tenant farmer was no longer an irritation; it was an
obsession. Ellisland, he told Gilbert, had undone his
enjoyment of himself. He looked forward with the
same desperate hope as his father’s at Mount Oliphant
to the ‘freedom in his lease’. The three-year
period of the £50 rental ended in 1791. After that,
if he chose to stay, Ellisland would cost £70 a year.
Naturally, his discouragement and defeat on the
farm had affected his relations with his landlord.
Miller’s kindness, he said, had been just such
another thing as Creech’s, and the fact that
Mrs. Miller had failed to appreciate one of his
poorer contributions to Johnson’s <i>Museum</i> did not
heighten his esteem for the family. He wanted no
more to do with landlords or anything that belonged
to them.</p>

<p>His only good luck at Ellisland came at the end.
The surrender of the lease did not annoy Miller as
Burns had expected, for a purchaser was in the
market, and Miller was glad enough to dispose of
the farm which the Nith separated from the rest of
his estate. After sending Jean and the children to
Mauchline, Burns held an auction of his standing
crops and provided the lavish drinks expected by
auction-goers. One result was that the exhilarated
bidders ran up the prices nearly a guinea an acre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
beyond the market rates; another was that house
and stable-yard were strewn with helplessly drunk
and retching neighbours. The sale brought ready
cash for the first time in two years, and Burns used
some of it to clear up a variety of small debts, including
the four pounds he owed his namesake,
Robert Burn of Edinburgh, for erecting Fergusson’s
tombstone. He also celebrated his manumission by
a brief visit to Edinburgh to say farewell to Clarinda
and to try to do something for sick and penniless
Jenny Clow.</p>

<p>While things had been going so badly on the
farm his position in the Excise had been improving.
After less than a year and a half in his laborious
rural division he had wangled a transfer to a vacant
‘footwalk’, the ‘3d, or Tobacco, Division’, in Dumfries.
This meant lighter work, and enabled him to
dispense with his horse—not too soon, for his poor
worn-out mare had given him several nasty falls on
the bad roads, bruising him severely and once breaking
his arm. In town, though, he had small opportunity
for increasing his income through fines and
penalties as he had done in the rural division. When
at the end of 1791 he moved his family into Dumfries
the best quarters he could afford were a
crowded and uncomfortable half-of-a-house in the
Stinking Vennel, near the river. He was still receiving
only the minimum salary of £50 a year, and
though Jean said long afterwards that they did not
come empty-handed into Dumfries not much cash
can have remained after he had discharged his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
debts. As early as March, 1790, he had estimated
that he would be lucky if he did not lose more than
£100 out of an investment of little more than £200.
Such anticipatory estimates are oftener under the
mark than over it; one suspects that if Burns recovered
as much as £50 of the money he had put into
Ellisland, he was lucky.</p>

<p>By comparison, his prospects in the Excise were
roseate. The Port Division in Dumfries, best paid of
the subordinate posts, was vacant, and Burns lobbied
for it with William Corbet, general supervisor
of Excise, as he had done with Graham of Fintry
for his first appointment. Corbet was an old friend
of Mrs. Dunlop’s, and her intercession was effectively
supplemented by a warm recommendation
from Findlater, the local supervisor. Burns got the
job early in 1792. The salary was £70 a year with
various perquisites worth another £20. It scarcely
represented luxurious living, but it was a better income
than most Scottish schoolmasters or even
ministers received in the eighteenth century, and
though ‘Robin’s temper was not cold and frugal’ he
managed to be fairly comfortable. After a year in the
Stinking Vennel he moved to a better house in what
was then called Mill Street and is now Burns
Street—the last of his numerous abodes.</p>

<p>Even before he left Ellisland Burns’s name had
been placed on the list of those eligible for promotion
to the rank of Supervisor. This was the most
laborious of the Excise posts, for the supervisors did
most of the real work of collection and administration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
They received salaries of from £200 to £400
a year, but their duties filled most of their waking
hours. So long as he was merely Port Officer Burns
had time and energy for reading and song-writing.
He knew, however, that when in the course of
seniority he became a supervisor most of this would
cease. But he was already looking beyond. The next
rank above Supervisor was Collector, and the collectors
held well-paid sinecures. In theory at least
supervisors were appointed by merit, but collectorships
admittedly went by favour, and Burns began
to cultivate political friendships which might in the
future secure him the necessary influence.</p>

<p>Not that he had any intention of soldiering on his
job and trusting to influence to lift him to a better
one. He was taking an intelligent interest in his
work and sought the attention of his superiors by
his understanding of their business. Thus he had
not been long in his Port Division before he wrote
to Provost Staig of Dumfries pointing out that the
town was losing revenue through failure to assess
a tax on imported ale, and backed his statement
with an estimate of the sums involved and some
shrewd advice as to the best method of getting his
chiefs to enforce their collection. A year or so later
he pointed out to Robert Graham that one of the
Dumfries divisions could be abolished and its duties
distributed among the other officers without overburdening
them. There cannot be many instances
on record of a government employee’s informing his
superiors that he was underworked. On this occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
at least Burns took an unusual way of drawing attention
to himself. He was also once more suggesting
his own advancement at the expense of another man,
but admitted the fact and coupled his recommendation
with a plea that if the change were made the
present incumbent, burdened with an expensive
family, be provided for elsewhere.</p>

<p>He would have been the last to claim that these
suggestions were free of any ulterior motive beside
the general one of making himself known as a
thoughtful and efficient officer. He had other and
more immediate purposes. Not long after showing
Provost Staig the revenue possibilities of the ‘twa
pennies’ tax on ale he had a petition to make to the
Burgh Council. When he first visited Dumfries in
1787 he had been made an honorary burgess; he
now wanted that nominal citizenship converted into
a real one so far at least as concerned the local
schools. The sons of burgesses were entitled to free
tuition at Dumfries Academy, and the chance of
getting his boys into a first-rate school was not to be
neglected. His petition set forth in detail the help he
had given to the local revenues. This may not have
been the reason why the Council at once granted
his application, but it certainly did not hamper it.
Similarly his letters to Graham were frankly motivated
by a desire to get a post as acting supervisor
at the earliest possible moment and thereby to secure
not only some small immediate increase in income but
the experience and reputation which would count
in his favour when a permanent position opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>These were reasonable and legitimate efforts to
gain prestige. He indulged in others more ticklish
and, in the perspective of history, more futile. Burns
lacked the right temperament for cultivating politicians,
but he could not help trying. He was once
introduced, for instance, to that very shady character,
the Duke of Queensberry, whom previously
he had rated with some justice as a complete scoundrel.
At their meeting the Duke proved affable, and
hearing that Burns had written a song about the
notorious ‘Whistle’ drinking bout mentioned that he
would like a copy. Burns sent it to him with a flattering
letter, no doubt hoping that at some future
date the Duke’s influence might be useful. There
was nothing particularly dangerous in this, for the
Duke’s rank made him a public character irrespective
of what party was in power. But when Burns
undertook to meddle in parliamentary contests he
was playing with fire. He had of course no vote himself,
but he wrote ballads in support of Whig candidates
and continued to do so until a few months
before his death. From the viewpoint of 1792 something
might have been said for this as good strategy,
regardless of the poet’s actual sympathies. Except
for the brief Rockingham ministry at the end of the
American War the Tories had been in power for
nearly a generation and a reversal was overdue.
When and if the Whigs came in a man who had supported
them in their time of adversity would be entitled
to special favours. Neither Burns nor anyone
else in Britain could foresee Napoleon and realize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
that Pitt’s ministry, which had already been on the
verge of disaster over the Regency Bill, would,
thanks to the Frenchman, remain in office until after
Burns and most of his parliamentary friends were in
their graves. As things turned out, silence would
have been the better part for Burns, but he had no
gift for silence.</p>

<p>In the same year moreover in which Burns secured
his Port Division the effects of the upheaval
in France were stirring both Burns and Scotland.
The cries of Liberty and Equality and Fraternity
were echoed in the North and enlisted as in England
a motley collection of supporters who ranged
from poetic idealists, like Burns and Wordsworth,
through professional agitators like Thomas Paine
and Horne Tooke to unprincipled rabble. Burns’s
first public gesture of sympathy with the French
Revolution came as a by-product of the most exciting
episode in his career as an Excise officer. In
the early spring of 1792 a smuggling schooner
named the <i>Rosamond</i> was caught in the Solway. The
ship was heavily armed and thanks to the active
co-operation of the coastwise folks, who staved in
all their rowboats to keep the Excise officers from
using them, she landed her cargo. The <i>Rosamond</i>,
however, remained aground on the tidal flats and
when an armed force of dragoons and Excise officers—Burns
among them—waded out to attack her
the crew fled after scuttling the ship. Salvaged and
towed into the Nith the <i>Rosamond</i> with all her gear
was confiscated and sold at auction. Her armament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
included four carronades which Burns bought for
£4 and dispatched as a gift to the French Convention.
Such at least is the traditional story, and every
detail of it, except the actual dispatch of the carronades,
is corroborated by documents found among
the Abbotsford papers. The tradition continues that
the guns never reached France, being seized by the
customs officials at Dover; but here again confirmation
is lacking. Legally there was nothing wrong in
Burns’s action. France and England were still officially
at peace, though their relations were steadily
growing tenser. Nevertheless, from the practical
viewpoint of a government employee with a dependent
family it was a gesture of almost criminal
recklessness. The government has never yet existed
which looked benevolently upon manifestations of
revolutionary sympathies among its servants, and
before many months had passed Burns had good
reason to be frightened.</p>

<p>The autumn of 1792 saw England ready to join
the coalition against revolutionary France, though
war was not declared until February 1, 1793. To the
privileged classes in England the war had all the
characteristics of a crusade except the obligation to
take a personal share. The Revolution threatened
the very foundations of the aristocratic social system,
and the depth of the government’s fear is measured
by the violence alike of official denunciations of
France and of the suppression of dissenting opinion
at home. Charges of sedition were pressed not only
against avowed revolutionary sympathizers but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
against almost anyone who had advocated the
slightest modification of the existing order. It was
not surprising that Burns, always unguarded in
speech and action, should face investigation of his
conduct. The details of the charges and their outcome
belong in another chapter. For a time Burns
thought that all his hopes of advancement were
blasted, but the storm soon blew over, and even
before he advertised his loyalty by enlisting in the
Dumfries Volunteers he had good reason to anticipate
that promotion would come in due course.</p>

<p>But though he escaped the storm of persecution he
did not escape the economic consequences of the
war. It had the usual and inevitable results of tight
money and rising prices; a wave of bankruptcies
swept over Scotland; the monthly lists of failures in
the <i>Scots Magazine</i> increased from an average of
half-a-dozen a month to forty-six in July, 1793, and
among the victims was Burns’s friend, Walter Auld
the saddler. The poet himself was not exempt. The
war cut off the greater part of the import trade and
with it much of the income and perquisites of Dumfries
Port Division. Burns had just begun to extend
his expenditures in keeping with his increased income.
The carronades and his better house were
only part of the expansion. He had backed a friend’s
note and had to pay it when the friend defaulted;
he had lent considerable sums to another friend, the
schoolmaster at Moffat, who was engaged in a long-drawn-out
wrangle with the Earl of Hopetoun,
patron of the school; there were other smaller loans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
as well. Caught thus with ready cash exhausted,
income reduced, and prices rising, Burns found himself
once again in the grimly familiar position of
being unable to pay his landlord. That the landlord
was a gentleman and a personal friend who did not
dun for his money made the situation more painful.
In January, 1795, Burns had actually to borrow
three guineas from his friend, William Stewart, in
order to pay part of his rent. Nevertheless even in
these hard times he managed occasional expenditures
that came in the class of luxuries—a week’s
tour in Galloway with John Syme, the restoration
of a Jacobite relic in form of Lord Balmerino’s dirk,
even a miniature portrait of himself. He and his
family never lacked for the necessaries of life, and
though he was somewhat in debt the accounting of
his executors is proof that the amount never passed
reasonable bounds.</p>

<p>As soon as the excitement over the sedition
charges subsided his prospects in the Excise brightened
steadily. Friends in Edinburgh were secretly
trying to get him transferred to a more lucrative
position, but even in Dumfries things looked hopeful.
At the end of December, 1794, Supervisor Findlater
fell ill, and Burns took over his duties. The
work lasted three months or more, and though it is
uncertain if Burns received any extra pay for his
labour he at least gained valuable experience and
competently handled his complex duties. The only
adverse criticism of his conduct related to a technical
irregularity in his final report, and this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
the fault not of Burns himself but of one of his subordinates.
The passage of each year brought him
higher on the list of candidates for supervisor’s posts.
Had he lived another year or two he would automatically
have been appointed even if his Edinburgh
friends had failed in their efforts to hasten
the process.</p>

<p>The prospect of promotion was becoming very
real—so real that during the very months when he
was acting as supervisor Burns devoted some of his
scanty leisure to composing a group of political
ballads. Patrick Heron of Heron—the same Heron
whose bank failure had once ruined half Ayrshire—was
the Whig candidate in a by-election at Kirkcudbright.
In return for the support of Burns’s pen
Heron asked if he could do anything for the poet.
Burns’s reply showed his mind at its coldest level of
realism. Nothing could be done, he said, for two or
three years, until he reached the head of the supervisors’
list. Then a political friend could be of service
in getting him appointed in some agreeable part of
the kingdom and of still more service in hastening
his next step in rank. Collectorships went by favour,
and the time he must spend in the drudgery of a
supervisorship would therefore depend on the
amount of influence his friends could exert. The
letter is graphic proof of Burns’s open-eyed acceptance
of the system in which he worked; it is also
proof of his irrepressible lack of discretion. From the
viewpoint of mere self-interest he would have done
better to hold aloof from all political contests and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
when the time came, to base his appeal for influence
upon his standing as a poet instead of identifying
himself with any party. But such calm calculation
was not in his nature.</p>

<p>In any case his hopes were vain. His disease was
gaining on him; he experienced sharp twinges of
pain which he and his doctors called rheumatism,
but which were probably angina pectoris. In
June and again in December, 1795, he had serious
illnesses which left him weak and shaken. In
the face of his increasing weakness he had taken on
additional labour by enlisting in a volunteer company
organized in Dumfries in the early spring.
The manual of arms and frequent drills were dangerous
medicine for a diseased heart, and to this
physical labour Burns added active participation in
all the business affairs of the corps. His final breakdown
could not in any circumstances have been long
delayed, but the Dumfries Volunteers undoubtedly
hastened it.</p>

<p>The winter of 1795-6 was a time of famine. Crops
had been bad; trade was dislocated by the war.
Nearly one-fourth of the inhabitants of Edinburgh
were being fed by charity, and flour was so scarce
that even those who could afford it were asked to
ration themselves to one loaf of bread per capita a
week. Conditions in the smaller towns were as bad
or worse; there were serious food riots in Dumfries
in February and March. With his health steadily
declining Burns was exposed to constant worry for
the welfare of his family. Excise officers who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
unable over long periods to perform their duties
because of illness were reduced to half-pay, and as
matters stood in the spring of 1796 half-pay would
have meant almost starvation for his children.
That things did not come to this pass for Burns was
due to the generosity of Adam Stobbie, who handled
his work for him and refused compensation for the
service. This relieved some of his immediate anxiety,
but did little to answer the main question of what
would become of Jean and the children if he died.</p>

<p>The problem of livelihood, never long absent
from his mind, occupied it during his last weeks almost
to the exclusion of other thoughts. The only
prescriptions the doctors could offer in his illness
involved expenditures he could not afford, and his
enlistment in the Volunteers now returned to plague
him. The tailor who had made his uniform began
to dun for payment, and to the poet’s fevered imagination
it seemed that his life was going to close as
his father’s had, under the shadow of a debtors’
prison. He spent some of his last days of consciousness
in writing frantic letters begging the friends to
whom he had lent money to repay their loans and
asking others like George Thomson and James Burness
to advance him money. Thomson was the only
one who gave grudgingly. The others willingly and
promptly sent what he asked, but too late to lift
the cloud from his dying mind. His last articulate
words were an imprecation against the tailor who
had threatened him, and he died without the comfort
of knowing that his death would awaken the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
generosity he had never experienced in his life, and
that the admirers of his poetry would make it possible
for Jean to keep her home together and for his
children to be decently educated and launched on
respectable careers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">SONG</p>


<p>Burns never wrote a ‘Prelude, or Growth of a Poet’s
Mind’, and left only a few fragments of his projected
satire on ‘The Poet’s Progress’. Yet his letters and
journals, as well as the poems themselves, so definitely
describe his moods and methods of composition
that his poetic psychology can be studied almost
as fully as Wordsworth’s own.</p>

<p>Conscious pleasure in poetry read or heard first
came to him in boyhood through one of Addison’s
hymns; mingled with martial and patriotic sentiment
he found it also in ‘The History of Sir William
Wallace’ and the Life of Hannibal. This latter, he
said, ‘gave my young ideas such a turn that I used to
strut in raptures up &amp; down after the recruiting
drum and bagpipe, and wish myself tall enough to
be a soldier, while the story of Wallace poured a
Scotish prejudice in my veins which will boil along
there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest.’
But this, like the similar thrills from all the odds and
ends of English poetry and Scottish song which came
his way, was commonplace boyish emotion. The
need and desire to write poetry of his own did not
awaken until his adolescent blood was warmed, in his
‘fifteenth autumn’, by the first consciousness of sexual
attraction in the company of Nelly Kilpatrick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I never expressly told her that I loved her.—Indeed I
did not well know myself, why I liked so much to loiter
behind with her, when returning in the evening from our
labors; why the tones of her voice made my heartstrings
thrill like an Eolian harp; and particularly, why my pulse
beat such a furious ratann when I looked and fingered
over her hand, to pick out the nettle-stings and thistles.—Among
her other love-inspiring qualifications, she sung
sweetly, and ’twas her favorite reel to which I attempted
giving an embodied vehicle in rhyme.—I was not so
presumtive as to imagine that I could make verses like
printed ones, composed by men who had Greek and
Latin; but my girl sung a song which was said to be
composed by a small country laird’s son, on one of his
father’s maids, with whom he was in love; and I saw no
reason why I might not rhyme as well as he, for ...
he had no more Scholarcraft than I had.’</p>
</div>

<p>‘Thus’, Burns summed up, with a juxtaposition of
ideas never far separated in his mind, ‘with me began
Love and Poesy.’ In all respects save one the
episode was the commonest experience of calf-love.
But that one difference was decisive. When a girl
roused him to lyric fervour, Burns did not sit down
and merely string his emotions together in rime.
Another element went to make the song; an element
that ultimately would mean more, poetically, to
Burns than any girl—namely, a tune. His mind did
not work from emotion directly to words; it worked
from emotion to music, and the music brought the
words which expressed its mood. Herein Burns was
almost unique among modern poets. Fully to appreciate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
his lyrics one must hear them sung to the airs
which evoked them. To read many of them in bare
print is like reading the libretto of an opera. Even in
his satires and epistles the process of composition was
usually the same, though another man’s poem, instead
of music, fired the train. Acquaintance with his
models is almost as illuminating as acquaintance
with his tunes.</p>

<p>His first effort at song-writing led to a conscious
study of the poet’s craft. The elaborate criticism appended
to ‘Handsome Nell’ when Burns copied the
poem into his Commonplace Book is too obviously a
bravura piece to merit consideration; more noteworthy
is his account of how he studied his collection
of English songs: ‘I pored over them, verse by
verse; carefully noting the true tender or sublime
from affectation and fustian.—I am convinced I
owe much to this for my critic-craft such as it is.’
But these were <i>English</i> songs, and their effect on his
early work shows mainly in such things as ‘My father
was a farmer’ and ‘Man was made to mourn’,
which latter in the Commonplace Book is entitled,
‘A Song: Tune, Peggy Bawn’. Even his most doleful
lines came to him in music.</p>

<p>But lugubrious notes were not the only ones. It
was as inevitable that a young Scot should try his
hand at metrical paraphrases of the Psalms as that
a young Etonian of the same century should paraphrase
Horace. The results in both cases are equally
negligible. Youth has to repeat the stale patterns of
its predecessors before it can find its own. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
much more important that ‘I murder hate by field
or flood’ was written in the same way. This is an epigrammatic
song in the Restoration manner, and as
English in language as in style. But it was written to
a Scottish air, ‘Gillicrankie’. The innate Scottish culture
of the poet was beginning, as early as 1781, to
assimilate and adapt the alien materials of Restoration
England.</p>

<p>Though Burns failed to act on Richard Brown’s
suggestion that he send some of his early verses to a
magazine, the idea stuck. The yeasty stirrings of a
still immature mind which had led him in 1780 to
plague his friends with pompous discourses on Pride
and Courage were slowly giving place to more personal
thinking on topics which he better understood.
His customary chronological vagueness in referring
to his early manhood makes it uncertain whether he
began his Commonplace Book before he discovered
the poems of Robert Fergusson, or after. The internal
evidence indicates the former. So does the elaborate
title-page:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Observations, Hints, Songs, Scraps of Poetry, &amp;c., by
Robt. Burness; a man who had little art in making
money, and still less in keeping it; but was, however, a
man of some sense, a great deal of honesty, and unbounded
good-will to every creature—rational or irrational.
As he was but little indebted to scholastic education,
and bred at a plough-tail, his performances must be
strongly tinctured with his unpolished, rustic way of life;
but, as I believe they are really <i>his own</i>, it may be some
entertainment to a curious observer of human-nature to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
see how a ploughman thinks and feels under the pressure
of Love, Ambition, Anxiety, Grief, with the like cares
and passions, which, however diversified by the modes
and manners of life, operate pretty much alike, I believe,
in all the Species.</p>

<p>“There are numbers in the world who do not want
sense to make a figure, so much as an opinion of their
own abilities, to put them upon recording their observations,

<p>Burns was already conscious of something more in
himself than there was in the average young peasant;
as an escape from worries over his own health
and the family’s future he was undertaking to leave
a record of himself to edify some hypothetical future
reader. Whatever tinge of humility there might be
on his title-page was, like the pretence at third-person
reporting, assumed. He meant to prove that a
peasant youth shared the feelings of his betters and
could rime and moralize to as good effect as they.
But the title-page, the quotations from Shenstone,
and the opening paragraph about Love all announce
a programme he soon abandoned. When he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
began the book he was still thinking in the terms of
his first letters about Pride and Courage; before he
ended it he was thinking in poetry.</p>

<p>Though he might continue to assert that he rimed
for fun, the fact was that from the day in April, 1783,
when he commenced the Commonplace Book he
was composing for publication, though not necessarily
for print. His earliest verses were either the
expression of a personal emotion, social <i>jeux d’esprit</i>,
or conventional exercises in versification, with no
purpose beyond the momentary and personal one;
the ‘Observations, Scraps of Song, &amp;c.’, were to be
his legacy to the world. Not by chance did the Commonplace
Book and its successor survive the general
destruction of his private papers when he supposed
himself on the eve of flight to Jamaica. Even though
by that time the best of his verse had escaped the
hazard of manuscript and was safely enshrined in
the good black print of the Kilmarnock volume, he
could not bring himself to destroy these records. It
was well that he saved them. The Commonplace
Book remains the sole record of what Burns was doing,
intellectually and poetically, between April,
1783, and October, 1785. Commencing with self-conscious
commentaries on life and on his own first
efforts at writing, it reveals before its close his steady
growth in artistic competence.</p>

<p>Not that it resembles the notebooks of Keats and
Shelley, with their evidence of how poems grow in
the poet’s mind. Burns’s poems stayed in his mind
until they were mature. His poverty and his method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
of composing to music combined to prevent his committing
half-formed ideas to paper. Paper was
scarce and expensive; often in his early days he
failed to write down his poems even when they were
complete. Sometimes he forgot them entirely; sometimes
he managed to reconstruct them long afterwards,
as he did when he recalled ‘The Mauchline
Wedding’ for Mrs. Dunlop’s amusement. One of the
few poems composed on paper is the disastrous
‘Elegy on the Death of Sir James Hunter Blair’,
which Burns drafted in his Border journal. Here he
was working with an English verse-form for which
no melody existed. It took him three different sittings
painfully to wring out the first seven stanzas.
Again in 1791 he reported that he had ‘these several
months been hammering at an Elegy’ on Miss Burnet
of Monboddo, but found elegy ‘so exhausted a
subject that any new idea on the business is not to be
expected’; the original manuscript of the ‘Lament
for James Earl of Glencairn’ reveals similar struggles.
When no tune sang itself in his head, composition
was labour and the results were wooden. The
‘Lament’, with a more lyric stanza and with stronger
personal feeling at its root, came nearer than the
others to success, but even it cannot be ranked
among the great elegies. Declining Cunningham’s
suggestion of a theme, he once said, ‘I have two or
three times in my life composed from the wish,
rather than from the impulse, but I never succeeded
to any purpose.’ In commemorating Lord Glencairn,
wish and impulse combined, yet even here he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
did not wholly succeed because the tune was lacking.</p>

<p>Poetic expression with Burns was not, as with
Wordsworth, the fruit of emotion recollected in
tranquillity; it was the fruit of emotion expressing
itself to music. Though as he grew older the emotion
no longer needed to be so strongly personal as when
he wrote his earliest songs, the dependence on music
became correspondingly greater. How he composed
in his later years he told George Thomson in the autumn
of 1793:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Until I am compleat master of a tune, in my own singing
(such as it is) I never can compose for it.—My way is:
I consider the poetic Sentiment, correspondent to my
idea of the musical expression; then chuse my theme;
begin one stanza; when that is composed, which is generally
the most difficult part of the business, I walk out,
sit down now &amp; then, look out for objects in Nature
around me that are in unison or harmony with the cogitations
of my fancy &amp; workings of my bosom; humming
every now &amp; then the air with the verses I have framed:
when I feel my Muse beginning to jade, I retire to the
solitary fireside of my study, &amp; there commit my effusions
to paper; swinging, at intervals, on the hind-legs of my
elbow-chair, by way of calling forth my own critical
strictures, as my pen goes on.—</p>

<p>Seriously, this, at home, is almost invariably my
way.—What damn’d Egotism!’</p>
</div>

<p>Though it would probably be impossible to overstress
Robert Fergusson’s influence on Burns’s development,
the elder poet’s primary service was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
clarify and confirm ideas already present but as yet
inarticulate in Burns’s mind. He knew what he liked,
and what his own poetic impulses were; the discovery
of Fergusson enabled him to define both his
method and his objective. To realize how much he
matured intellectually between the beginning of the
Commonplace Book in 1783 and its conclusion in
1785, one need merely read the strutting, self-conscious,
and essentially empty criticism of ‘expletive
phrases’ of ‘too serious sentiment’, and ‘flimsy
strain’ which he appended to ‘Handsome Nell’, or
the pseudo-devotional passage about the grand end
of human life being ‘to cultivate an intercourse with
that Being to whom we owe life’. These things of
1783 are juvenilia. The following, written in September,
1785, is adult:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘There is a certain irregularity in the Old Scotch Songs,
a redundancy of syllables with respect to that exactness
of accent and measure that the English Poetry requires,
but which glides in, most melodiously with the respective
tunes to which they are set. For instance, the fine old
song of “The Mill Mill O,” to give it a plain prosaic
reading, it halts prodigiously out of measure; on the other
hand, the song set to the same tune in Bremner’s collection
of Scotch Songs which begins “To Fanny fair could
I impart,” &amp;c., it is most exact measure, and yet, let
them both be sung before a real critic, one above the
biasses of prejudice, but a thorough Judge of Nature, how
flat and spiritless will the last appear, how trite, and
lamely methodical, compared with the wild-warbling
cadence, the heart-moving melody of the first. This particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
is the case with all those airs which end with a
hypermetrical syllable. There is a degree of wild irregularity
in many of the compositions and fragments which
are daily sung to them by my compeers, the common
people—a certain happy arrangement of Old Scotch
syllables, and yet, very frequently, nothing, not even <i>like</i>
rhyme, or sameness of jingle at the ends of the lines. This
has made me sometimes imagine that perhaps, it might
be possible for a Scotch Poet, with a nice, judicious ear,
to set compositions to many of our most favorite airs ...
independent of rhyme altogether....’</p>
</div>

<p>With nothing except mother-wit and a sure ear to
guide him, Burns had reached conclusions regarding
poetic rhythm at complete variance with the critical
theories of his century and beyond the practice of
even nineteenth-century orthodoxy. He had recognized
that the real charm of folk-poetry lies in the
fact that it is musical rather than regular. In an age
when the essence of poetry was thought to abide in
the accurately counted syllables of the heroic couplet
such an opinion would have seemed not merely
heresy but sheer insanity. Compared with it, Coleridge’s
supposed innovation of hypermetrical syllables
in <i>Christabel</i> is timid conventionality. Blake
alone among Burns’s contemporaries had bolder
theories of rhythm, and his work, which the Scotsman
never saw, had to wait more than half a century
for recognition. Burns later expended much
time and ink in trying to persuade George Thomson
that a song could be poetry even if all its lines did
not count up the same number of syllables, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
was never optimistic enough to offer that silly body
a lyric which dispensed with rime.</p>

<p>So, too, in regard to the physiology and psychology
of composition, Burns, before he ever published
a line, had reached closer to fundamentals than an
academician like Hugh Blair could ever go. Like
Milton he had recognized from his own experience
that there is in many poets a seasonal rhythm of
creativeness. In himself it usually began in August,
and continued for several months. That month, he
said in his autobiography, was always a carnival in
his bosom; in 1793 he told Thomson, ‘Autumn is
my propitious season. I make more verses in it, than
all the year else,’ and at the beginning of the next
summer he repeated the assertion: ‘Now, &amp; for six
or seven months <i>I shall be quite in song</i>.’ In other
words, it took all the scanty sunshine of the Scottish
summer to bring him physically to that level of well-being
at which creation was possible.</p>

<p>The psychology of composition, moreover, which
he explained in prose in 1793 he had defined in poetry
in the epistle to William Simpson of Ochiltree,
composed in May, 1785, and published in the Kilmarnock
volume. It is surprisingly like A. E. Housman’s,
who recorded that some of his best poems
came to him spontaneously while walking on Hampstead
Heath and thinking of nothing in particular,
after drinking a pint of beer at luncheon. Burns’s
formula is precisely similar:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Muse, nae Poet ever fand her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till by himself he learn’d to wander</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Adown some trottin burn’s meander,</div>
    <div class="verse indent7">An’ no think lang.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In these circumstances, when his emotional pressure
was high enough, lines and stanzas would come unsought
to his mind, and it was to this experience he
referred when he repeatedly called himself ‘a Bard
of Nature’s making’. Burns knew as well as Housman
did that this spontaneous birth was only the beginning
and not the end of composition. Gilbert reported
the process without realizing its significance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Robert often composed without any regular plan.
When anything made a strong impression on his mind,
so as to rouse it to any poetic exertion, he would give
way to the impulse, and embody the thought in rhyme.
If he hit on two or three stanzas to please him, he would
then think of proper introductory, connecting, and concluding
stanzas; hence the middle of a poem was often
first produced.’</p>
</div>

<p>It suited with the role of inspired ploughman which
Burns assumed among the Edinburgh gentry to give
the impression that the finished poem also was spontaneous,
but he knew better. His poetry was often
born under the open sky, with the physical rhythm
of his farm-work supplying the muscular accompaniment
he later sought in strolls on the banks of Nith,
but it was matured and revised by concentrated
study of the implications of his theme. As the piper
has to walk his measure, so Burns’s body moved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
the rhythm of the tune which was in his mind, and the
rhythm brought the words which expressed his mood.</p>

<p>It was only Scots music that saved Burns in the
end from complete subjection to the false elegance
of his century. Though he was better read than most
of his ‘patrons’ ever realized, he had the self-educated
man’s diffidence in the face of established
reputations. His ear, so quick to distinguish ‘the true
tender or sublime’ from ‘affectation or fustian’ in
a lyric, failed him in the reading of more pretentious
works. ‘The Cotter’s Saturday Night’ is shot full of
verbal echoes of English poets; what is worse, it
echoes their sentiments, in such a passage as Stanza
X, to an extent which divorces the thought from all
the realities of peasant life. He never acquired the
degree of sophistication which would have enabled
him to use the current English conventions freely
and originally, yet he was too sophisticated to use
old folk conventions when they were not reinforced
by music. Thus he never—with the possible exception
of ‘John Barleycorn’—wrote a serious ballad.
His political verses, and above all such an uproarious
parody as ‘The Ballad of Grizzel Grimme’,
show that he had all the ballad conventions at his
tongue’s end; he had collected numerous old ballad
texts, of which Dr. Currie named more than a dozen
to Sir Walter Scott, though without thinking it worth
while to preserve them; yet he could employ the
ballad only in satire or burlesque. Thanks to music,
he was able in all seriousness to sing a song in the old
folk style, but he could not tell a story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>Even his Scottish vocabulary was more literary
and derivative than his contemporaries realized. It
was not so much a direct transcript of Ayrshire
speech as it was a generalized vernacular pieced
together from Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson,
and the anonymous folk lyrists and ballad writers.
He was genuinely interested in the variations of
dialect—on his Border tour, for instance, he jotted
down definitions of local words which were new to
him—but his poetic use of it was chiefly due to its
pithiness, its humour, and, above all, its flexibility.
This was what he had in mind when he admitted to
Robert Anderson ‘the advantages he enjoyed ...
from the <i>copia verborum</i>, the command of phraseology,
which the knowledge and use of the English and
Scottish dialects afforded him’. He habitually alternated
between Scottish and English spellings of the
same word, as the exigencies of rime and measure
required, thereby achieving a more flexible expression
than was possible in either dialect by itself. His
vernacular writing, in short, was nearer to Lowell’s
New England speech or Kipling’s Cockney than it
was to Gawain Douglas’s or William Dunbar’s
single-minded expression in his native tongue. Even
Robert Fergusson’s dialect, with its strong infusion
of Fifeshire elements, is closer than Burns’s to being
a direct transcript from life.</p>

<p>In one sense the poems in the Kilmarnock volume
which were written under Robert Fergusson’s influence
are a divergence from Burns’s deepest impulses,
even though his method of composing them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
was fundamentally the same as in his song-writing.
Instead of a tune to which he could set his own
words Fergusson supplied a pattern or a theme to be
adapted to his own experience. The parallels between
‘The Plane-stanes and the Causey’ and ‘The
Brigs of Ayr’, between ‘The Daft Days’ and ‘Hallowe’en’
or ‘The Holy Fair’, between ‘Caller
Oysters’ and ‘Scotch Drink’ or ‘To a Haggis’ are too
obvious and have been too often mentioned to need
reiteration. Burns borrowed, but he did not copy;
even borrowed phraseology he made his own. His
imitations almost invariably surpassed their originals
both in poetic fire and in the epigrammatic
quality essential for quotability. Yet in these forms
of verse he showed no inventiveness. His own phrase
that Fergusson had roused him to <i>emulating</i> vigour is
literally true. That Fergusson’s impetus failed to
sweep Burns on to discover similar themes of his own
reveals him as after all on foreign ground. Nevertheless,
by demonstrating that poetry could still be
written in the vernacular, Fergusson had done inestimable
service. Beyond that his influence brought
Burns to a dead end. The unhappy young lawyer’s
clerk had no music in his soul.</p>

<p>Allan Ramsay rather than Fergusson showed the
way to the sort of poetry without musical setting in
which Burns found his genuine freedom and inspiration.
The imitations of Fergusson end with the lines
‘To a Haggis’, written in December, 1786; Ramsay
supplied the models for the vernacular epistles
which Burns never wholly ceased to write until a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
few months before his death. And between the poetic
epistle as Burns wrote it and the dramatic monologue
in which he also excelled there is little basic
difference. The writer of a poetic epistle is usually
dramatizing himself. Like the professional humorist,
he assumes a role which is a projection or exaggeration
of one phase of his own temperament, but
which is not really himself as the working-day world
knows him. For Burns to pass from such self-dramatization
as marks the epistles to Lapraik, Simpson,
Rankine, and Smith to the pure drama of ‘The Auld
Farmer’ or even ‘Holy Willie’s Prayer’ involved
merely an extension of imaginative scope and not a
different technique.</p>

<p>To put it another way, Burns could either talk or
he could sing. When he was not writing to music he
was at his best only when he was speaking, either
for himself as personified bard or humorous spectator,
or as he identified his own personality with another’s.
Nothing in the poems composed in 1786
more clearly shows his maturing artistic powers
than does the dramatic character of ‘The Auld
Farmer’ and ‘Holy Willie’ when contrasted with the
lyrics of ‘The Jolly Beggars’, composed the year before.
In these last, magnificent as they are, the
reader can seldom forget that it is Burns who is
speaking through the mouths of the vagabonds. The
lyrics are only half dramatic, and perhaps it was
realization of this that made the poet in 1793 tell
George Thomson that none of the songs pleased
him except the last—in which Burns himself is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
speaking as the ‘Bard of no regard’. In ‘Holy Willie’
and ‘The Auld Farmer’, on the other hand, the poet
has identified himself with the character whom he
is portraying as completely as Browning ever did
with Fra Lippo Lippi or the Duke of Ferrara.</p>

<p>Less than adequate notice has been taken of the
fact that Burns had mastered the art of the dramatic
lyric and the dramatic monologue more than half a
century before Browning gave the forms their
names. His own statement that all his early lyrics
had a personal basis has both led biographers on
wild-goose chases after autobiographical elements
in songs which possess none, and has been used to
give false emphasis to many poems really based on
personal experience. Such interpretations ignore
the very foundation of creative art. That the impulse
to write a lyric comes from personal emotion does
not mean that the finished poem is literal history.
Keats’s love for Fanny Brawne helped to make ‘The
Eve of St. Agnes’ what it is, but not even Mr. Middleton
Murry has been fatuous enough to call
Madeline a portrait of Fanny. Rose Aylmer was not
necessarily as perfect as Landor’s elegy upon her;
William Douglas may have had no real intention of
laying him down and dying for Annie Laurie. Yet
the whole Highland Mary legend, for instance, rests
on precisely this sort of treatment of a handful of
Burns’s songs, in obstinate disregard of the plain
fact that the woman who inspires a love-lyric no
more needs to be herself a lyric woman than the
model for the Victory of Samothrace needed to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
woman with wings. Everyone has recognized Burns’s
unsuccess in his effort to dramatize himself for Clarinda’s
benefit as the pure man of sentiment; his true
achievement could be better understood by recognition
of his success in dramatizing his real self in
many of his best ‘personal’ poems. From the ‘Mary
Morison’ of his youth to the ‘O wert thou in the
cauld blast’ of his last illness, his best songs display
not Burns himself but a dramatic projection of one
aspect of his mind.</p>

<p>Commentators from Henry Mackenzie onward
have regretted that Burns never carried out his plans
for writing a drama. Yet his triumph in the dramatic
monologue is the best reason for believing
that the attempt would have failed. His numerous
references to the drama and dramatic writing never
so much as hint that Burns had grasped the elements
of theatrical technique. For him a play was merely
a vehicle for declamatory speeches and the expression
of ‘sentiments’ which would make neat quotations;
a cobbling together of purple patches and of
scattered episodes supposed to depict ‘originality of
character’. If it ever occurred to him that a good
play is a unified structure in which a single impression
is built up through a series of artfully contrived
climaxes, he never put the idea on paper. But even
had he understood the technique he had not the
right psychological approach for dramatic writing,
any more than Browning had. The true dramatist
stands apart from his characters and develops them
from without; the writer of dramatic monologues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
identifies himself for the moment with another individual
and develops the character from within.
The two temperaments are seldom united in one
man, and Burns in turning away even from the pastoral
drama which Mackenzie had urged him to
undertake was once again instinctively following the
bent of his own genius. In the light of what he accomplished
in his chosen forms, Mackenzie’s suggestion
was almost as inept as John Moore’s proposal
that he try something like Virgil’s Eclogues.</p>

<p>Before he went to Edinburgh Burns had explored
his own capacities, but had not yet realized more
than half of them. Fergusson had shown him how to
write satires and descriptions in the vernacular;
Ramsay had revealed the possibilities of the poetic
epistle. But his interest in the folk-songs of which the
words and melodies haunted him, still seemed a
rustic or even childish survival. So far as he knew,
it was like taking nursery rimes seriously as poetry.
Though he must have been aware that scholars of
repute were beginning to collect old ballads, he had
not yet discovered that they were turning also to
the words and music of folk-songs. In this respect at
least, his Edinburgh sojourn was of incalculable
benefit. Apparently he never met David Herd, the
greatest collector among his contemporaries, but
he soon became acquainted with Herd’s published
work and learned that even some university professors
esteemed such things. Sending a couple of
songs, ‘the composition of two Ayrshire Mechanics’,
to the Rev. William Greenfield a few weeks after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
arriving in the city, he hailed that eloquent but incontinent
clergyman as ‘Professor of the Belles
lettres de la Nature’; in the following summer he
told William Tytler that he had once a great many
fragments of traditional literature, but as he had no
idea that anybody cared for them, he had forgotten
them. And his next remark showed that he already
possessed the essential qualification of the collector:
‘I invariably hold it sacriledge to add anything of
my own to help out with the shatter’d wrecks of
these venerable old compositions; but they have
many various readings.’ Yet not even then, not even
though the singing of old melodies was one of the
commonest amusements both in Edinburgh drawing
rooms and at convivial meetings at taverns, did
he realize immediately the task and the opportunity
before him.</p>

<p>The convivial meetings at first meant much more
to him than the drawing-rooms. The jolly gentlemen
who made up the Crochallan Fencibles had
probably as a group little interest in pure poetry,
but they had a very lively interest in brisk songs.
If the songs happened to be improper, that was no
handicap among a club which included Charles
Hay and William Smellie and Robert Cleghorn,
and to whom Alexander Cunningham used to sing
‘charmingly’ one of the most indecent of Irish ditties.
Burns’s memory was already well stored with such
gems, and in this congenial company he added to
his stock, enriched old songs with new stanzas of his
own, and occasionally composed original verses of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
the same type, as he had often done at Mauchline.
As a means of enhancing the pleasures of male
company over a bowl of punch such song-writing
amused him and delighted the Fencibles.</p>

<p>Not until after his Edinburgh <i>Poems</i> were off the
press did it begin to dawn upon him that he might
also win new fame in the drawing-room and—what
meant much more to him—do a patriotic service to
Scotland. In the last weeks of April, 1787, he made
the acquaintance of an engraver named James
Johnson, who was just bringing out the first volume
of a work which he called <i>The Scots Musical Museum</i>.
Johnson was known to Smellie, Dunbar, and others
of Burns’s friends, but he cannot have been in the
inner circle of the Crochallans, or Burns would have
met him sooner. He was almost illiterate—his picturesquely
bad spelling is notable even for the eighteenth
century—but he was an enthusiast for the collection
and preservation of the traditional music
and songs of his country. He had invented a process
for printing music by stamping the notes on pewter
plates instead of the steel or copper engraving then
generally employed. Though the result was a mean
and smudgy page, the process was much cheaper
than the old one and encouraged Johnson to try his
hand at publishing. His enthusiasm, however, far
exceeded his knowledge. He had had difficulty in
gathering the hundred songs which made up his
first volume, and had even eked it out with a few
English pieces. His meeting with Burns not only remade
the <i>Museum</i>, but, poetically considered, was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
most important event of the poet’s life in the capital.</p>

<p>Writing to Johnson on the eve of his Border tour
Burns regretted that they had not met sooner: ‘I
have met with few people whose company &amp; conversation
gave me more pleasure, because I have
met with few whose sentiments are so congenial to
my own.’ But though he contributed a song or two
to the collection, the idea that he might take an
active part in the work was still far from his mind.
The fantastic Earl of Buchan, as early as February,
had advised Burns to ‘fire [his] Muse at Scottish
story and Scottish scene.’ Burns had replied, in language
even more inflated than the Earl’s: ‘I wish for
nothing more than to make a leisurely Pilgrimage
through my native country; to sit &amp; muse on those
once hard-contended fields where Caledonia, rejoicing,
saw her bloody lion borne through broken
ranks to victory and fame; and catching the inspiration
to pour the deathless Names in Song.’ Unfortunately,
added the poet, he had instead to go back to
working for his living. Nevertheless, the Border tour
offered a chance to fulfil part of the Earl’s suggestion—according
to Burns’s real tastes, if not the
Earl’s. His greatest pleasures on the journey were
not the civic receptions and the elaborate hospitality
of the gentry, but the sight of Gala Water, Leader
Haughs and Yarrow, the Bush aboon Traquair,
Elibanks and Elibraes, and other spots celebrated in
song. It made no difference whether the song was
singable before ladies or before Crochallans, so long
as it was Scottish, and old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>The Highland tours added so effectively to his
stock that in 1793 he was able to say that he had
made pilgrimages to every spot commemorated in
Scottish song except Lochaber and the Braes of Ballenden.
Presumably on his passages through Edinburgh
in August and September he talked with
Johnson, but not until late October, after his return
from Ochtertyre, did he really begin to put his
energies into the work. Johnson obviously had solicited
his help, and the poet’s first move was to
write to all his friends who possessed words or music
which might be usable. Nor did he confine himself
to his own circle of acquaintance. Learning to his
chagrin that he had unwittingly passed near the
home of the Rev. John Skinner without calling to pay
his respects to the author of ‘Tullochgorum’ and
‘John o’ Badenyon’, he seized the opportunity given
by receipt of a poetic epistle from Skinner to beg the
venerable clergyman’s support for Johnson’s enterprise.
He soon started also to fit words of his own to
fine melodies which either lacked them or had unsuitable
ones—at first with a personal motive, in
order to publish the complimentary verses he had
written to Margaret Chalmers and Charlotte Hamilton,
but soon with no purpose except that of supplying
his favourite music with words which could be
sung. Moreover, he commenced to gather all available
publications of Scottish songs and song music.
How thoroughly he went into this search is revealed
by his quiet remark to George Thomson five years
later: ‘Let me have a list of your airs, with the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
line of the verses you intend for them.... I say, the
first line of the verses, because if they are verses that
have appeared in any of our Collections of songs, I
know them &amp; can have recourse to them.’ He had in
fact ranged so widely in the old song books that even
yet his editors have been unable to identify the originals
of some of the songs he altered and adapted for
the <i>Museum</i>, and later on for Thomson’s <i>Select Collection</i>.
But though in 1787 he realized better than
Johnson did the magnitude of the task and the opportunity
before them, he was still unaware of its
true scope. He conjectured that there would be
three volumes of a hundred songs each. The completed
work filled six.</p>

<p>From October, 1787, onwards Burns was in fact
though not in name the chief editor of the <i>Museum</i>.
He collected words and music, wrote prefaces for the
successive volumes, and helped to enlist the aid of a
competent musician, Stephen Clarke, organist of
the Episcopal chapel in Edinburgh, in harmonizing
the airs. Johnson willingly submitted to the poet’s
leadership, which he needed. The surviving correspondence
shows Burns carrying on a struggle
which nothing except his enthusiasm for the work
could at times have made endurable. Johnson required
constant supervision even in such elementary
matters as spelling; Clarke’s carelessness and indolence
were maddening. The work sold slowly and
Johnson, under the pressure of other affairs, inclined
to procrastinate. ‘Why,’ Burns asked in 1793, and
the passage is typical of many, ‘did you not send me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
those tunes &amp; verses that Clarke &amp; you cannot
make out? Let me have them as soon as possible,
that, while he is at hand, I may settle the matter
with him.’ Clarke, ‘with his usual indolence’, was
worse. More than once he mislaid or lost whole
sheafs of songs which had been entrusted to him.
‘“The Lochmaben harper”’, said the poet in 1795,
‘I fear I shall never recover; &amp; it is a famous old
song.—The rest are, I doubt, irrecoverable.—I
think it hard that, after so much trouble in gathering
these tunes, they should be lost in this trifling
way.—Clarke has been shamefully careless.’ Yet
Burns’s enthusiasm kept him going, however negligent
or incompetent the partners on whom he had
to depend. The time-table of the work is sufficient
proof of his influence. Volume II, prepared while
he was in Edinburgh, was ready six months after
Volume I; the next two volumes, for which the
poet’s contributions had to be made by correspondence,
took two years each. Volume V was prepared
while Burns was working also for George Thomson;
it was four years on the stocks. The final volume,
prepared by Johnson’s unaided efforts, took six
years, even though he had still on hand a considerable
quantity of Burns’s verse for which space had
been lacking in the earlier numbers.</p>

<p>Burns’s preface to the second volume, published
in February, 1788, in the very midst of the Clarinda
imbroglio, shows how completely, in the fifteen
months since his first arrival in Edinburgh, the poet
had awakened to the literary importance of folk-song.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
‘Ignorance and Prejudice’, he wrote, ‘may
perhaps affect to sneer at the simplicity of the poetry
or music of some of these pieces; but their having
been for ages the favourites of Nature’s Judges—the
Common People, was to the Editor a sufficient test
of their merit....’ He was no longer apologetic for
his interest in popular literature. If the highbrows
could not appreciate it, so much the worse for the
highbrows. He was determined, moreover, that no
poet of the people should lack recognition if it were
possible to give it. ‘Wherever the old words could
be recovered, they have been preserved; both as
generally suiting better the genius of the tunes,
and to preserve the productions of those earlier
Sons of the Scottish Muses, some of whose names
deserved a better fate than has befallen them—“Buried
’mong the wreck of things which were.”
Of our more modern Songs, the Editor has inserted
the Authors’ names as far as he could
ascertain them.’ The passage is almost a direct
transcript, even to the hackneyed quotation from
Blair’s <i>Grave</i>, of what Burns had written in the Commonplace
Book two and a half years before, when
he added that it had given him ‘many a heart-ake’
to reflect that the names of such glorious old Bards
were clean forgotten. No more of them should be
forgotten if he could do anything to prevent it. The
‘communal’ theory of ballad-composition still slumbered
in Cloud-Cuckoo-Land; Burns was sure that
somewhere at the source of every old song was an
individual poet of like passions with himself, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
such as he himself might still be but for the accident
of print.</p>

<p>His one exception to the rule of publishing authors’
names was his own contributions. He told
Mrs. Dunlop that the songs signed ‘R’, ‘B’, or ‘X’
were his own, and those signed ‘Z’ were old songs he
had altered or enlarged. But no one can go through
the volumes with this simple key and identify all of
Burns’s contributions. His own negligence and
Johnson’s omitted his initials from numerous songs
unquestionably his own, and the verses signed ‘Z’
have puzzled the ingenuity of editors ever since.
Burns admitted that ‘of a good many of them, little
more than the Chorus is ancient; tho’ there is no
reason for telling every body this piece of intelligence.’
Sometimes his own annotations or the survival
of earlier texts show the extent of his contributions,
ranging from eking out a too-brief song with
an extra stanza of his own to composing a whole
lyric to fit a fragment of traditional chorus. Public
opinion unanimously credits Burns with ‘Auld Lang
Syne’, yet he never claimed it. He declared that it
‘had never been in print, nor even in manuscript’,
until he took it down from an old man’s singing.
Three different times, for people as unlike as
Mrs. Dunlop, Robert Riddell, and George Thomson,
he wrote out the words without even an indirect
claim to their authorship. Nevertheless, no trace of
the song in anything like Burns’s form has ever been
found in earlier records, and the public has refused
to believe that a poem of such appeal could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
been current without being noticed. On the other
hand, every stanza of ‘A Red Red Rose’ has been
traced to some older poem; yet Burns’s skill in selecting
the one good image in a mass of commonplace
and weaving his cento of borrowings into a
single compact and vivid lyric makes the song his
own, as <i>Macbeth</i> is Shakespeare’s and not Holinshed’s.</p>

<p>In such lyrics as these and scores of others Burns
had achieved a sort of dramatic impersonation
which far surpassed even the best of his earlier
monologues and dramatic lyrics. Guided always by
the spirit of the music, he had so identified himself
with the thoughts and feelings of the anonymous
and half-articulate folk poets whose songs he was
rescuing from oblivion that the most critical eye
cannot be certain where their work ends and Burns’s
begins. Again and again he took fragments of old
work and not only reunited them into coherent
wholes but gave the restored poem the lyric elevation
its original author had felt but could not express.
Emerson said that an institution was the
lengthened shadow of a single man: Scottish song
as the world knows it today is the lengthened shadow
of Robert Burns. What he did not actually write is
so coloured by his influence that it could not exist
without him. With the exception of Lady Nairne’s,
his was the last poetry written in the old folk tradition.
The romantic sentimentality which tinges
Burns’s songs at their weakest, overspreads many of
Lady Nairne’s; Scott’s masterpiece, ‘Bonnie Dundee’,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
is glorious, but it is not a folk-song. Most of
what has been written since 1800 is merely imitation
Burns.</p>

<p>The <i>Museum</i> was Burns’s opportunity to combine
his poetic inclinations with his fervent patriotism.
But it was more than that. By enlisting the poet’s
help in his enterprise, Johnson unwittingly furnished
him the means of sustaining his creative life amid his
toil as farmer and Exciseman. After 1788 extended
composition was probably impossible for Burns. He
could scarcely hope to be revisited by the almost
continuous excitement under which he wrote the
greater part of his first volume, and without emotional
excitement he could not create. He had
plenty of leisure for writing during his Edinburgh
days, but the urge was lacking. His whole sojourn
there produced less poetry than a single month at
the beginning of 1786. Removal to Ellisland, with
all the strain of its ‘uncouth cares and anxieties’,
brought his creativeness to a still lower ebb. Repeatedly
he complained that the Muses had deserted
him; during his first two years on the farm the
‘Lines in Friars Carse Hermitage’ were almost his
only serious attempt at non-musical composition,
and in the revision of the poem he wavered between
versions in a manner wholly unlike the vigour
of 1786. The frequency, indeed, with which he circulated
both versions among his friends suggests at
times a bankrupt’s clinging to the last relic of his
prosperity. But thanks to the <i>Museum</i> he had work
to do which could be shaped to music as he followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
his business, and be committed to paper in his
snatches of free time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, under Burns’s leadership, the whole
plan of the <i>Museum</i> had been altered. The original
scheme had been merely to collect the existing songs.
For this task—at least for all the songs that were
printable—Johnson’s first estimate of two volumes
was not a serious understatement. Burns, ransacking
the collections of instrumental music, and stealing
time from his farm work to listen to a fiddler playing
over the pieces that had interested him, discovered,
however, that Scottish music was teeming with good
tunes to which no words had ever been set. The reels
and strathspeys which fiddlers and pipers played as
dance tunes had just as much lilting charm as the
airs of traditional songs. His plan now was nothing
more nor less than supplying words to every cottage
melody which was capable of vocal interpretation.
He was also making musical experiments in tempo,
finding that gay tunes played in slow time might be
transformed into ‘the very language of pathos’. The
name ‘Museum’ was growing steadily more inappropriate;
the work was becoming an experimental
laboratory in both poetry and music. Probably
Burns never fully defined, even to himself, the scope
of the ambitious project he did not live to achieve,
but the more than three hundred songs he left are
evidence that if anyone could have achieved it, he
could.</p>

<p>Not that all these songs are masterpieces. Burns
had no illusions on that score. His contention was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
always that the music was the important thing, and
that a good air might better have mediocre words
than none at all. Nevertheless when he was composing
Scottish words to tunes of his own choice the
percentage of the commonplace was small and the
range of themes extraordinarily large. The critics
who read autobiography into every love poem pass
lightly over the fact that in some of the best love
lyrics, such as ‘Tam Glen’, ‘An’ O for ane-and-twenty,
Tam’, and ‘Whistle and I’ll come to you,
my lad’, the speaker is a woman, and that such
wholly dramatic lyrics as ‘M’Pherson’s Farewell’
and ‘John Anderson’ have a more sustained intensity
of emotion than the admittedly autobiographic
‘Ae fond kiss’. When Burns’s lyrics were commonplace
it was usually because he was composing them
to tunes not of his own choice; above all when such
assigned composition demanded English words.
Music which worked downward from the intellectual
to the emotional centres could never give the
same creative release as when the engagement of
the emotions came first. Such was the case with the
last of his major poetic projects—supplying lyrics
for George Thomson’s <i>Select Collection of Scotish Airs</i>—but
before turning to that work something must be
said of the last and finest of the poems which he did
not write to music.</p>

<p>‘Tam o’ Shanter’ is not only Burns’s greatest single
poem but one of the finest short poetic narratives
in all literature. It is the only one of Burns’s works of
which it may truly be asserted that he opened a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
field wherein he never had the chance to reveal the
full range of his powers. In the satire and the epistle,
as in the lyric, he had abundantly displayed both his
strength and his limitations. In the versified folk-tale
‘Tam’ stands alone; it is, as he said, his ‘standard
performance in the Poetical line’. Though he
was doubtless right in concluding that it showed ‘a
force of genius &amp; a finishing polish that I despair of
ever excelling’, he might in happier circumstances
have equalled it. But here, as in the satires and epistles,
his inspiration came from without, and the
stimulus was never repeated.</p>

<p>The story of its composition is too familiar to need
rehearsing in detail. In 1789 Francis Grose the antiquary
arrived at Friars Carse in the course of a collecting
tour. He had successfully published an elaborately
illustrated work on the antiquities of England
and Wales, and was now gathering material for
a companion volume on Scotland. The fat and jovial
captain, whose encyclopædic knowledge ranged
from ancient arms and armour, costume, and ecclesiastical
and military architecture, to the ribald
slang of his day, was as unlike Sir Walter Scott’s
bookish Jonathan Oldbuck as any man could well
be. Beside his vast erudition and ardent spirit the
amateurish antiquarianism of Robert Riddell faded
away. Grose was one of the most stimulating men
Burns ever met, and the friendship which sprang up
between them had the double basis of community
of interest and congeniality of spirit. Burns saw in
Grose’s projected book an opportunity to glorify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
his own birthplace, and suggested that the ruins of
Alloway Kirk were a good subject for an illustration.
Grose, no doubt mentally comparing the
scrubby little church with the glories of Melrose and
Arbroath, hesitated. Alloway had neither grandeur
of architecture nor richness of historical association.
The latter, however, might be supplied. Burns had
been telling some of the tales of the supernatural
which he had heard in his boyhood, and Grose
agreed to include the picture of Alloway if Burns
would furnish a witch-legend to accompany it. Thus
casually his greatest poem was born.</p>

<p>Burns’s qualifications for writing this tale of witchcraft
were analogous to his qualifications for writing
folk-songs. In each instance he belonged by education
to a world where such things were no longer
alive. But his childhood and youth had been spent
among people to whom they were still real. Intellectually
he had no more belief in witchcraft than
Benjamin Franklin had, but he knew the minds of
the people who did believe. Hence the blend of
broad humour and real terror which makes the
poem unique. To an Elizabethan audience there
was nothing humorous about the witches in <i>Macbeth</i>;
they were real beings inspiring fear and hatred.
To Washington Irving or Charles Dickens a tale of
the supernatural was purely an excursion into the
Land of Make-Believe. It is only when a belief is
fading but not yet dead that it can be handled with
the mixture of humour and conviction which Burns
used. Ghost stories suffered the same fate about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
century later, as scepticism regarding personal immortality
became more widely prevalent. And ‘Tam
o’ Shanter’ is as perfect in structure as it is unique in
tone. Custom cannot stale it. To read it or hear it
read for the hundredth time is still to be swept along
by the rush of the narrative and to realize more
clearly the artistry which balances each increasingly
wild episode with its introductory paragraph of humorous
philosophizing. A few of its early readers,
Mrs. Dunlop among them, thought the poem scandalously
indecent; to the rest it was an artless effusion
of the Heaven-taught ploughman. If any early
reader realized that besides being a merry tale it was
a consummate work of art the opinion was not committed
to print. In 1791 literary art still connoted
eighteenth-century ‘elegance’.</p>

<p>Could Burns have had more of the society of a man
like Grose, had even young Walter Scott of Edinburgh,
who in the intervals of his legal studies was
already steeping himself in the ballads and legends
of the Border, thought it worth while occasionally to
ride as far as Dumfries to visit the man whom he had
once seen in an Edinburgh drawing-room, the
world might have more poems like ‘Tam o’ Shanter’.
But there was no one in Dumfries to provide
the necessary stimulus. Robert Riddell took much
but had little to give; his sister-in-law Maria belonged
too much to the world of fashion to have any
enthusiasm for folk-tales; John Syme’s taste ran
more to satirical epigrams than to narrative poetry.
And these three represented the best intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
companionship Dumfries had to offer. As for Edinburgh,
the influences dominating the literary life of
Scotland at the end of the century were better represented
by George Thomson than by Francis Grose.</p>

<p>In September, 1792, Burns received a letter from
a friend of Alexander Cunningham’s, asking aid in
a poetical and musical venture. George Thomson,
clerk to the Board of Trustees in Edinburgh, was
two years the poet’s senior and possessed all the elegance
of taste which Burns’s education had protected
him from. Thomson enjoyed Scottish music
in his ultra-refined way, but was irked by the crudity
of the traditional songs. Baldly stated, his proposal
was to collect a hundred of the best Scottish melodies,
to get a professional musician to dress them in
all the frills necessary for concert performance, and
to provide them with tidy English lyrics which
would disguise their provincial origin. In writing to
Burns, however, he did not express himself so
bluntly. After explaining that Ignaz Joseph Pleyel,
‘the most agreeable composer living’, had been engaged
to arrange the music, he continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘To render this work perfect, we are desirous to have
the poetry improved wherever it seems unworthy of the
music; and that it is so, in many instances, is allowed by
everyone conversant with our musical collections. The
editors of these seem in general to have depended on the
music proving an excuse for the verses; and hence some
charming melodies are united to mere nonsense and doggerel,
while others are accompanied with rhymes so loose
and indelicate as cannot be sung in decent company. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
remove this reproach would be an easy task to the author
of “The Cotter’s Saturday Night”.... It is superfluous
to assure you that I have no intention to displace any
of the sterling old Songs: those only will be removed
which appear quite silly or absolutely indecent....’</p>
</div>

<p>The publication, in short, was to be a sort of Golden
Treasury of Scots music, and Burns’s share in the
work was to be ‘writing twenty or twenty-five songs,
suitable to the particular melodies’ which Thomson
selected. The editor said nothing, in this first letter,
about his preference for English words.</p>

<p>No literary salesman ever received more enthusiastic
response than Thomson got from Burns. The
poet promised whole-hearted co-operation, but he
had detected enough of Thomson’s temperament to
make certain reservations. In order of importance
they were these. His share in the work was to be a
patriotic labour of love, and he would accept no
compensation. For the time being at least his participation
was to be anonymous—perhaps because
he did not wish his official superiors to think he was
neglecting his Excise duties; perhaps because he
feared that Johnson might conclude that he was deserting
the <i>Museum</i>. He was not to be asked to compose
unless he could do so spontaneously, and
Thomson was to have free editorial authority to take
or reject his contributions. Finally, ‘If you are for
<i>English</i> verses, there is, on my part, an end of the
matter.—Whether in the simplicity of <i>the Ballad</i>, or
the pathos of <i>the Song</i>, I can only hope to please myself
in being allowed at least a sprinkling of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
native tongue.’ English verses were precisely what
Thomson <i>was</i> for, ‘because the English becomes
every year more and more the language of Scotland,’
but he hastened to disavow any wish to confine
the poet to English—preferring to wait and
argue it out later, poem by poem.</p>

<p>Greater enthusiasm, knowledge, and art were
never enlisted under more incompetent leadership
than in Burns’s alliance with Thomson. It did not
take the poet long to discover that the elaborate
plan which Thomson had outlined in his first letters
was really as vague as an Edinburgh fog. The editor
had not yet decided on the list of airs he intended
to include; he had not succeeded in getting the co-operation
of the English poetaster, John Wolcot
(‘Peter Pindar’), to write English songs; Pleyel, who
was supposed to be handling the music, soon departed
on a visit to Germany and found his return route to
Britain closed by the armies of the French and the
Allies. James Beattie was to have been asked to furnish
an introductory essay on Scottish song, but
Beattie was old and ill and not really interested in
the subject. In consequence of all this, Burns, who
had begun on the understanding that he was to
furnish only a few lyrics, shortly found himself saddled
with the entire burden of the literary end of the
work. Even so his position, though laborious, would
not have been difficult had Thomson been merely
muddle-headed. But as soon as the editor had furnished
the list of the twenty-five airs he meant to include
in the first number of his collection, and Burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
had sent in his first group of lyrics, Thomson revealed
himself as a literary tinker. He was constantly
proposing amendments in phraseology—which always
meant substituting banal English expressions
for racy Scots ones. At times his niggling criticism
was too much even for Burns’s enthusiasm and good
nature. One letter, for instance, began with the
abrupt outburst, ‘That unlucky song “O poortith
cauld,” &amp;c. must stand as it stands—I won’t put my
hand to it again.’ In later years Thomson, to sustain
his pose as whole-hearted admirer of all Burns’s
work, carefully inked over that sentence in the manuscript.
But he was guilty of worse than that. Burns,
as always, was steeping himself in the rhythms of the
airs to which he was composing; Thomson had to
display his own musical knowledge by suggesting
that the proffered song be set to another tune. The
fact that to Burns the words and the tune were always
inseparable never penetrated his mind.</p>

<p>Occasionally Burns came forward with a lyric
written to an air not on Thomson’s list, and at such
times the editor’s taste and tact were most fully displayed.
For instance, Lady Elizabeth Heron, wife of
Patrick Heron, from whom Burns hoped for political
favours, had composed a little tune called ‘Banks of
Cree’ and asked Burns to supply it with words.
Burns told the lady he would like her permission to
publish the song, and sent the words to Thomson,
saying that ‘the air I fear is not worth your while,’
but evidently hoping that Thomson would ask for
it. Thomson instead proposed setting the words to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
an air on his own list, ‘Young Jockey was the blithest
lad’. Burns replied sharply: ‘My English song, “Here
is the glen &amp; here the bower” cannot go to this air; it
was written on purpose for an original air composed
by Mrs. Heron of Heron.’ But after the poet’s death
Thomson erased the vetoing phrase and published
the words to the tune, ‘The Flowers of Edinburgh’,
thereby leaving Burns under the imputation of having
lied to Lady Elizabeth in promising to publish
her music.</p>

<p>Another time Burns found himself haunted by the
old lilt of ‘Hey tutti taitie’, which a wholly unreliable
tradition declared to have been Bruce’s march
to Bannockburn. At the end of August, 1793, his
impotent fury over the Edinburgh sedition trials,
combined with his enthusiasm at the news of the
French levy <i>en masse</i> for the repulse of the Allied invasion,
found an outlet in composing ‘Scots wha
hae’ to this air. Historically the song is an anachronism.
The ideas underlying it are those of Rousseau
and Thomas Jefferson and not of the feudal Middle
Ages; its very language is Scoticized English rather
than the true vernacular—Sir James Murray
pointed out, for instance, that in real Scots the
opening phrase would be ‘Scots that has’. The song
owes its enduring popularity largely to the perfect
union of the words with the music they were composed
to. But when Burns sent it to Thomson, that
worthy thought the music vulgar, and suggested
that lengthening the fourth line of each stanza would
fit the words to another tune, ‘Lewis Gordon’, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
he liked better. This time Burns yielded, accepted
the silly changes, and thereafter circulated the song
always in the weakened version. Thomson published
it in this form after the poet’s death, but the appearance
of the original version in Currie’s edition
showed the music-loving public the immense superiority
of Burns’s first thought. Thomson bowed to
public opinion, and consigned his ‘improvements’ to
the oblivion they deserved.</p>

<p>In most instances, however, the public had no
chance of checking up on Thomson’s disregard of
Burns’s wishes, and by destroying his own end of the
correspondence, after furnishing Dr. Currie with
some carefully edited extracts from it, the editor
sought to cover up the extent of his nagging criticisms.
Inasmuch as his vandalism stopped short of
destroying Burns’s letters the ultimate publication
of their complete texts exposed the nature of his
fault-finding almost as clearly as if he had preserved
his own originals. He nevertheless inked out a number
of passages in which Burns was too outspoken in
comment on his taste, or seemed to deny his claim
to the copyright of the poet’s contributions. Thomson
was intensely jealous of Johnson’s <i>Museum</i>, disliked
Johnson personally, and resented Burns’s continuing
to help the rival work. Again and again in
the letters Burns would say that if a song did not
suit, Thomson was to return it, and Burns would
send it to the <i>Museum</i>. To keep the material out of
Johnson’s hands, Thomson never definitely rejected
anything. He carefully docketed the letter in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
Burns said that he had given Johnson no permanent
copyright in his songs, but inked over passages
which indicated that Burns was contributing to the
<i>Select Collection</i> on precisely the same terms as to the
<i>Museum</i>.</p>

<p>When Burns’s health was failing in the spring of
1796 Thomson sought to frighten him by a report
that a pirated edition of the songs was being
planned, and enclosed for the poet’s signature a legal
document assigning him the whole copyright.
Burns, ill though he was, and careless as he had always
been of his literary property, refused to sign,
and sent instead ‘a Certificate, which, though a little
different from Mr McKnight’s model, I suppose
will amply answer the purpose,’ adding that ‘when
your Publication is finished, I intend publishing a
Collection, on a cheap plan, of all the songs I have
written for you, the Museum, &amp;c.—at least of all
the songs of which I wish to be called the Author.’
This was tantamount to telling Thomson that he
had a claim on the first serial rights only, and though
Thomson later published two different texts of what
he alleged was Burns’s deed of assignment, he never
produced the original holograph, and it was not preserved
among his papers. In after years Thomson
tried the same trick on Sir Walter Scott and Sir
Alexander Boswell. He had succeeded in making
Burns’s executors believe that he owned the copyrights
and was generously waiving them for the benefit
of the subscription edition, but Scott and Boswell
were lawyers and saw to it that where their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
work was concerned he got no more than the serial
rights.</p>

<p>Burns ought to have treated Thomson as Beethoven
did in 1813, when the editor demanded changes
in the airs which the great musician had undertaken
to harmonize:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I regret that I am unable to oblige you. I am not accustomed
to tinker my compositions. I have never done
so, being convinced that every partial modification alters
the whole character of the composition. I am grieved
that you are out of pocket through this, but you cannot
lay the blame on me, for it was your business to make
me more fully acquainted with the taste of your country
and the meagre abilities of your performers.’</p>
</div>

<p>But such blunt truth-telling was more than Burns
was ever capable of to a man who claimed taste and
education. He said what he thought about his songs,
but said it gently and deferentially, and left them in
Thomson’s hand to be mangled or misapplied.</p>

<p>To go into such detail of Thomson’s misdoings
would be pointless had he been merely a thick-headed
and thick-skinned editor who failed to appreciate
what Burns was doing for him. But Thomson
was much more than that. He represented the
whole Anglicizing tendency of the Scottish gentry
and bourgeoisie who were seeking to destroy the
language and individuality of their country. ‘Now
let me declare off from your taste.—“Toddlin hame”
is a song that to my taste is an exquisite production
of genius.—That very Stanza you dislike</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My kimmer &amp; I lay down to sleep”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>
<p>is to me a piece of charming native humour.—What
pleases me, as simple &amp; naive, disgusts you as ludicrous
&amp; low.—’ So said Burns in one of the passages
which Thomson tried to obliterate. But Thomson’s
opinions were shared by most of his educated countrymen,
including some of Burns’s most intimate
friends. Where earlier criticism of the poet’s vernacular
work had failed to break down his Scotticism by
the very absurdity of such suggestions as imitating
Virgil, Thomson tried to accomplish it by the more
insidious means of minor verbal changes which individually
seemed to amount to little but which in
their cumulative effect would emasculate the poetry.
It is generally recognized that Burns’s contributions
to the <i>Select Collection</i> include a much larger
percentage of the conventional and the commonplace
than does his work for the <i>Museum</i>; the marvel
is that in the circumstances he achieved so much
that was not second-rate. He was composing to order,
frequently sending off by return of post the
lines to a particular tune which Thomson had asked
for, and his efforts were constantly hampered by
his consciousness that certain themes and methods
would never please the silly editor’s taste. It was no
wonder that many times he had to induce a synthetic
emotional thrill in himself—either by putting
himself through a course of admiration for a handsome
woman, or by the help of a bowl of punch—in
order to be able to compose at all.</p>

<p>His power of poetic response to music and emotion
nevertheless did not fail with his failing health.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
A few weeks before his death he asked Jessie Lewars,
sister of one of his best friends among the Excise officers
of Dumfries, to play him her favourite tune.
She responded with the roguish little air, ‘The robin
cam to the wren’s nest, and keekit in, and keekit in’.
Burns, humming the tune to himself and altering
the tempo, produced almost extemporaneously the
beautiful ‘O wert thou in the cauld blast’. From his
earliest lyric to his latest, music was the catalyst
which transformed emotion into poetry. Yet for
more than a century after his death the dominating
influence of music on his art went almost unrecognized;
and George Thomson, the man who of all
others among Burns’s contemporaries had had the
best opportunity to realize the nature and the
power of his lyric expression, wrote an obituary
which, besides inaugurating the legend of mental
and moral deterioration in the last years at Dumfries,
summed up its author’s appreciation of the
wit, critical acumen, and real erudition of Burns’s
letters by saying that probably the poet ‘was not
qualified to fill a superior station’ to the humble one
he held in the Excise. Of all the Holy Willies who
eyed Burns askance during his life and after his
death, he would probably, had he realized his true
character, have despised Thomson most. The others
were merely trying to blacken Burns’s own character.
Thomson was trying to destroy the vitality of
Scottish song.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">THE SCOT</p>


<p>Not merely in his struggle for livelihood and in the
poetic art which immortalized him was Burns a
Scot of the Scots. He was equally so in his religion,
his politics, and, above all, his patriotism. Only in
this last was he untypical of his generation. Yet such
statements are misleadingly simple. All they can
safely mean is that Burns, like all men in all ages,
was influenced in thought and conduct by the environment
in which he lived. Nevertheless, in a
nation so small and self-contained as Scotland in
the eighteenth century the pressure of environment
was felt to a degree unrealized in larger and more
cosmopolitan communities. In England during
Burns’s manhood the social and literary worlds of
Burke and Sheridan and Horace Walpole, of Cowper,
of John Wesley, of Godwin, of Blake, touched
each other only lightly and tangentially; in the rising
generation of Wordsworth, Jane Austen, Lamb,
and Byron the separations would be even wider.
Scotland by comparison was all of a piece. Even her
greatest philosophers, Adam Smith and David
Hume, even the much-travelled and Anglophile
Boswell, retained their national stamp.</p>

<p>Though in their final form Burns’s religious ideas
differed little, if at all, from the sentimental ‘common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
sense’ deism of England and France, the
process by which he reached them was Scottish.
The rigidity of the doctrines to which he was subjected
in his youth determined the vigour of his reaction
from them. As David Hume would scarcely
have been so militantly sceptical if he had been
reared in a milder faith, so Burns might have been
less sentimental. His earliest teachings, it is true,
did not stress the more rigorous themes in Scottish
Calvinism. The preaching of Dr. William Dalrymple
of Ayr, whose church the Burnes family attended
during the years at Alloway and Mount
Oliphant, was notably mild and gentle; William
Burnes’s own little ‘Manual of Religious Belief’,
though it gave a reasonably orthodox definition of
the Fall of Man, was silent on such doctrinal points
as predestination and the Four-Fold State. Undoubtedly,
therefore, the Old Light tenets of Daddy
Auld of Mauchline made a deeper impression on
Burns’s eighteen-year-old mind than they would
have done had he been exposed to them from infancy.
Yet Burns had encountered <i>The Man of Feeling</i>
before he left Mount Oliphant; the doctrines of
sentiment and deism were in the air he breathed;
his emotional nature would have brought him to
them sooner or later, regardless of other stimuli.
The most that can be attributed to Auld is a little
hastening and intensifying of the process of revolt.</p>

<p>Despite his constant citing of Young’s exhortation,
‘On Reason build Resolve’, Burns’s approach
to life and ideas was always emotional and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
intellectual. When he described himself in 1786 as
having little of divinity ‘except a pretty large portion
of honour and an enthusiastic, incoherent
Benevolence,’ his self-analysis had his customary
accuracy. To him, as to the New England Unitarians
and to a man like Mark Twain, escape from
the orthodoxy of his youth had come as a relief and
not as a loss. Calvinism had erected a system of
thought as rigidly deductive as the science of geometry.
Starting from certain ‘self-evident’ axioms like
the omnipotence and omniscience of God, the fall
of man, and the literal authority of the Scriptures,
it had created a religious philosophy from which all
emotion except fear had been removed. Through
the sin of Adam all men had earned damnation, but
the inscrutable mercy or caprice of God would
choose a remnant minority for salvation—for His
merit, not theirs. Human faith and human righteousness
were filthy rags.</p>

<p>This cold determinism outraged Burns’s sense of
fairness and justice, as it outraged Channing’s and
Emerson’s and Holmes’s. It seemed to him that the
New Lights were ‘squaring Religion by the rules of
Common Sense, and attempting to give a decent
character to Almighty God and a rational account
of his proceedings with the Sons of Men.’ But in
investing their deity with human benevolence and
loving-kindness, the New Lights were also, again
like the New England Unitarians, more or less unwittingly
surrendering the supernatural sanctions
of religion and assimilating their ideas to those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
the Deists. God was the ‘Great First Cause, least
understood’; Christ tended to sink from Godhead to
merely an inspired human teacher; personal immortality
became a pious hope instead of a divine promise.
If man were indeed immortal, the surest passport
to salvation was righteous living rather than
adherence to a particular creed. And the guide to
righteous living was the still small voice of conscience,
the Moral Sense which Francis Hutcheson
had taught was an innate human faculty.</p>

<p>In his attitude towards these doctrines, Burns was
a man of his century and a Scot of his century. The
rigidity of the Kirk, so unlike the comfortable looseness
of Anglican theology, left him no place within
its pale, even though he never openly severed his
connexion. As a youth he had, along with most of
his countrymen, read popular works of divinity like
Boston’s <i>Four-Fold State</i>, Fisher’s <i>Marrow of Modern
Divinity</i>, and Cole <i>On God’s Sovereignty</i>. In 1791, when
his rural neighbours of the Monkland Friendly Society
insisted on adding these and other books to
their co-operative library, Burns obediently ordered
them from Peter Hill, and lumped them all together
as ‘damned trash’. Though he told James Candlish
in 1787 that after having ‘in the pride of despising
old women’s stories, ventured in “the daring path
Spinoza trod”; ... experience of the weakness, not
the strength, of human powers, made me glad to
grasp at revealed religion,’ it was not the revelation
of the Kirk. Not even his infatuation for Clarinda,
though it made him momentarily qualify his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
admiration for Milton’s Satan, could compel him to
bow the knee to Calvin. ‘Mine’, he told her when
she undertook to preach orthodoxy to him, ‘is the
Religion of the bosom.—I hate the very idea of controversial
divinity; as I firmly believe, that every
honest, upright man, of whatever sect, will be accepted
of the Deity.—If your verses, as you seem to
hint, contain censure, except you want an occasion
to break with me, don’t send them.... “Reverence
thyself” is a sacred maxim, and I wish to
cherish it.’</p>

<p>His fullest statement approximating to orthodoxy
was written to Mrs. Dunlop in 1789:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I have just heard Mr Kirkpatrick preach a sermon.
He is a man famous for his benevolence, and I revere
him; but from such ideas of my Creator, good Lord,
deliver me! Religion ... is surely a simple business,
as it equally concerns the ignorant and the learned, the
poor and the rich. That there is an incomprehensible
Great Being, to whom I owe my existence; and that He
must be intimately acquainted with the operations and
progress of the internal machinery, and consequent outward
deportment, of this creature which He has made;
these are, I think self-evident propositions. That there
is a real and eternal distinction between virtue and vice,
and, consequently, that I am an accountable creature;
that from the seeming nature of the human mind, as well
as from the evident imperfection, nay, positive injustice,
in the administration of affairs both in the natural and
moral worlds, there must be a retributive scene of justice
beyond the grave; must, I think, be allowed by every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
one who will give himself a moment’s reflection. I will go
farther, and affirm, that from the sublimity, excellence,
and purity of His doctrine and precepts, unparalleled by
all the aggregated wisdom and learning of many preceding
ages, though, <i>to appearance</i>, He Himself was the obscurest
and most illiterate of our species—therefore Jesus
Christ was from God....’</p>
</div>

<p>Another time he told the same lady, ‘We can no
more live without Religion, than we can live without
air; but give me the Religion of Sentiment &amp;
Reason.—You know John Hildebroad’s famous
epitaph—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here lies poor old John Hildebroad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have mercy on his soul, Lord God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he would do, were he Lord God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou wert poor John Hildebroad.”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This speaks more to my heart, &amp; has more of the
genuine spirit of Religion in it, than is to be found
in whole wagon-loads of Divinity.’ This was the
same mood in which he had told Clarinda, ‘My
creed is pretty nearly expressed in the last clause of
Jamie Deans’s grace, an honest weaver in Ayrshire;
“Lord, grant that we may lead a gude life! for a
gude life maks a gude end; at least it helps weel!”’
Reason and Sentiment, but with the sentiment
much more powerful than the reason, these were
the dominant forces in Burns’s religious attitude.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Burns was more courageous than
many of his contemporaries in accepting the logical
consequences of belief in universal benevolence. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
man knew more clearly the warfare between flesh
and spirit, but he was convinced that both were the
gifts of God. The lines which so shocked Wordsworth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘But yet the light that led astray</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Was light from Heaven’,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>are his frankest summary of his experience. Whatever
sufferings his passions had brought upon him,
the passions in themselves were noble. Asceticism
had no appeal for him. He took life as God made
it, and saw that it was good.</p>

<p>Taken by themselves, his utterances to Clarinda
and Mrs. Dunlop might not be above suspicion.
Burns had every motive for wishing favourably to
impress both women, and might have feigned an
interest which he did not feel, or at least have overstated
his belief and understated his doubts. But
here, as in his feelings towards his children, what
he said when he may have been on dress-parade is
confirmed by his letters to his intimates. In 1788
he wrote to Robert Muir, then dying of tuberculosis:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘... An honest man has nothing to fear.—If we lie
down in the grave, the whole man a piece of broken machinery,
to moulder with the clods of the valley—be it so;
at least there is an end of pain, care, woes and wants: if
that part of us called Mind, does survive the apparent
destruction of the man—away with old-wife prejudices
and tales!... A man, conscious of having acted an
honest part among his fellow-creatures; even granting
that he may have been the sport, at times, of passions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
and instincts; he goes to a great unknown Being who
could have no other end in giving him existence but to
make him happy; who gave him those passions and instincts,
and well knows their force.’</p>
</div>

<p>In the same tone he said six years later to Alexander
Cunningham that the two great pillars which bear
us up, ‘amid the wreck of misfortune and misery’,
are the ‘certain noble, stubborn something ...
known by the names of courage, fortitude, magnanimity’
and ‘those feelings and sentiments which,
however the sceptic may deny them or the enthusiast
disfigure them, are yet, I am convinced, original
and component parts of the human soul; those
<i>senses of the mind</i> ... which connect us with, and
link us to, those awful obscure realities—an all-powerful
and equally beneficient God, and a world
to come, beyond death and the grave.’</p>

<p>The countryman of Francis Hutcheson could
scarcely have indicated more clearly his obligations
to the Glasgow philosopher. Burns’s ‘senses of the
mind’ are merely Hutcheson’s Moral Sense a little
expanded. Like Channing and Emerson, having
rejected the authority of the church, and with it
the supernatural sanctions of Christian doctrine,
Burns fell back on the authority of intuition to support
concepts which he was unwilling to abandon.
The idea of the deity, and His relations with mankind,
which is embodied in these passages, he never
deviated from; what seemed to many of his readers
shocking irreverence was aimed at intolerance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
hypocrisy, and not at religion. But he was not able
in all moods to convince himself of personal immortality.</p>

<p>At times he tried to argue himself into belief:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The most cordial believers in a Future State have
ever been the Unfortunate.—This of itself; if God is
Good, which is, I think, the most intuitive truth in Nature,
... is a very strong proof of the reality of its
existence....’</p>
</div>

<p>and he went on to reason that since the ideas of
‘<span class="allsmcap">OUGHT</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">OUGHT NOT</span>’ are ‘first principles or
component parts of the Human Mind’ and are
synonymous in our thinking with virtue and vice,
the soul <i>must</i> be immortal because, ‘except our Existence
<i>here</i>, have a reference to an Existence <i>hereafter</i>,
Virtue &amp; Vice are words without meaning.’ Thus
he argued to Mrs. Dunlop, who had just told him
that her daughter, Mrs. Henri, was widowed after a
few months of marriage. But not long before he had
said to Cunningham,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘All my fears &amp; cares are of this world: if there is another,
an honest man has nothing to fear from it.—I hate a man
that wishes to be a Deist, but I fear, every fair, unprejudiced
Enquirer must in some degree be a Sceptic.—It
is not that there are any very staggering arguments
against the Immortality of Man; but, that like Electricity,
Phlogiston, &amp;c. the subject is so involved in darkness
that we want Data to go upon.—One thing frightens me
much: that we are to live forever, seems too good news
to be true....’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>An emotional man deprived of any authority except
emotion on which he could rely, Burns’s religious
views are of a piece with his politics and his
patriotism. To get at the underlying emotions is to
explain what appear to be glaring contradictions in
thought. John Ramsay of Ochtertyre found Burns’s
politics ‘abundantly motley’, for the poet managed
to combine strong sympathy for the exiled House of
Stuart with liberal if not republican views on contemporary
affairs. To Ramsay this seemed like being
simultaneously Catholic and Protestant, whereas it
was only putting into words the unexpressed philosophy
that had swayed the popular mind of Scotland
for close on a century. Burns admired Lord Balmerino,
noblest of the victims of the ’45; he also
admired John Wilkes. Between a devoted Jacobite
like Balmerino and a radical Whig like Wilkes,
there was only one point in common: both were
anti-Hanoverian. That one point reconciles Burns’s
divergent opinions. The Stuarts embodied the ideal
of Scotland as an independent nation; even though
from the accession of James to the death of Anne
they had governed Scotland from London they still
commanded the loyalty of their old kingdom. But
the Georges were, as Burns said, ‘an obscure, beef-witted,
insolent race of foreigners whom a mere
conjuncture of circumstances kickt up into prominence
and power.’ His phrase summarizes in vigorous
prose the spirit of the ribald satirical songs by
which Scotland had avenged herself for the humiliations
following the rebellions of 1715 and 1745.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
Burns was far from maintaining that the Stuarts
were perfect, or that the Revolution of 1688 lacked
justification; what he did maintain was that the
Hanoverian system was not perfect either.</p>

<p>On the Fifth of November, 1788, Burns attended
a special service of thanksgiving held at Dunscore
Kirk to celebrate the centenary of the Revolution.
The Rev. Mr. Kirkpatrick’s remarks about ‘the
bloody and tyrannical House of Stuart’ sent the
poet home to write an open letter to his friend
David Ramsay, editor of the Edinburgh <i>Evening
Courant</i>, in which he mingled unveiled satire with
a sense of historical perspective hardly to be looked
for in an ‘unlettered ploughman’. He went to
church, he said, to give thanks for ‘the consequent
blessings of the Glorious Revolution. To that auspicious
event we owe no less than our liberties religious
and civil—to it we are likewise indebted for
the present Royal Family, the ruling features of
whose administration have ever been, mildness to
the subject, and tenderness of his rights.’ But, he
continues, cannot we give thanks for our present
blessings ‘without, at the same time, cursing a few
ruined powerless exiles, who only harboured ideas,
and made attempts, that most of us would have
done, had we been in their situation?’ ‘Were the
royal contemporaries of the Stuarts more mildly
attentive to the rights of man? Might not the
epithets of “bloody and tyrannical” be with at least
equal justice, applied to the house of Tudor, of
York, or any other of their predecessors?’ In short,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
the Stuarts were only fighting for prerogatives
which former monarchs of England and contemporary
monarchs of France enjoyed unchallenged,
and the poet disclaims ability to determine whether
their overthrow ‘was owing to the wisdom of leading
individuals, or to the justling of party.’ And
then comes the sting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Man, Mr. Printer, is a strange, weak inconsistent
being.—Who would believe, Sir, that in this our Augustan
age of liberality and refinement, ... a certain
people, under our national protection, should complain,
not against a Monarch and a few favourite advisers, but
against our whole legislative body, of the very same imposition
and oppression, the Romish religion not excepted,
and almost in the very same terms as our forefathers did
against the family of Stuart! I will not, I cannot, enter
into the merits of the cause; but I dare say, the American
Congress, in 1776, will be allowed to have been as able
and enlightened, and, a whole empire will say, as honest,
as the English Convention in 1688; and that the fourth
of July will be as sacred to their posterity as the fifth of
November is to us.’</p>
</div>

<p>The concluding sentence of that peroration is
paraphrased from a speech John Wilkes had delivered
in the House of Commons ten years before.
Manifestly Burns followed, closely and sympathetically,
the utterances of the English radicals and reformers;
it is well known that ‘A Man’s a Man’ is
‘two or three pretty good prose thoughts inverted
into rhyme’ from the writings of a former Excise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
officer named Thomas Paine. Like most European
liberals, Burns admired the leaders of the American
Revolution—one of the toasts which gave offence in
Dumfries is said to have been his proposal of the
health of George Washington as ‘a better man’ than
William Pitt—and his admiration would be intensified
by obvious parallels between the grievances of
the Americans and the Scots. His Jacobite sympathies
were wholly emotional, and in part conditioned
by the fact that the Jacobites had written
all the good songs. One suspects that he would just
as readily have taken the Catholic view of the
Reformation if Scottish Catholics had embalmed
their lost cause in poetry. When he looked at current
affairs, his reason backed his feelings. Politically,
Scotland had almost as much to complain of
as the American colonies had had. In some respects,
indeed, she had more. American towns had been
free to manage their local affairs by a system of
representative government; in Scotland the municipalities,
like the country’s representation in Parliament,
were self-perpetuating oligarchies. Burns,
in common with thousands of men of higher rank,
had no vote even in the government of his own
burgh. Yet his dislike of the system and his contempt
for most of its leaders would probably have expressed
itself only in occasional satires had it not
been for the outbreak of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>A movement for reform of both burgh and parliamentary
government was under way in Scotland.
George Dempster, one of the few men of independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
mind among the Scottish representatives at
Westminster, advocated such measures of reform as
would allow ‘the industrious farmer and manufacturer
[to] share at least in a privilege now engrossed
by the great lord, the drunken laird, and the drunkener
baillie.’ Country gentlemen of unimpeachable
character took up the agitation, and Burns’s letters
to men like William Robertson of Lude, John
Francis Erskine of Mar, and Richard Oswald of
Auchencruive, show that he looked to such leadership
as the hope of the country. When his conduct
was under inquiry Burns declared that he had, as a
government employee, taken no active part, either
personally or as an author, in the movement for reform,
but that as a man he ‘would say that there
existed a system of corruption between the Executive
Power &amp; the Representative part of the Legislature,
which boded no good to our glorious Constitution;
&amp; which every patriotic Briton must wish
to see amended.’</p>

<p>The early stages of the French Revolution roused
the enthusiasm of the more liberal-minded men of
all classes in Scotland. A dinner in Edinburgh to
celebrate the second anniversary of the fall of the
Bastille was attended by a group of university students
which included John Allen, stepson of the
poet’s friend Robert Cleghorn, by numerous country
gentlemen like his friend Robert Riddell and
his acquaintance Alexander Fergusson of Craigdarroch,
and by Lord Daer. It seemed to men like
Craigdarroch and Daer that the popular interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
in the principles of the Revolution might be harnessed
for the benefit of Scotland in speeding measures
for burgh and parliamentary reform. Actually
the brief alliance with French sympathizers delayed
reform for forty years. All the vested interests of
Great Britain rallied to support Burke’s condemnation
of the revolutionary principles, and the counter-attack
swept away every attempt to alter in the
slightest degree the existing scheme of things.</p>

<p>The full weight of the counter-attack was not
felt at once. Indeed, it was a Scotsman, James Mackintosh,
who published the fullest and best-reasoned
of the numerous replies to Burke. Besides seeking to
confute Burke, Mackintosh tried to rally his countrymen
to the cause of reform by citing their medieval
reputation as lovers of liberty who would die
rather than surrender their freedom. Certain passages
in Mackintosh were probably as directly responsible
for the composition of ‘Scots wha hae’ as
<i>The Rights of Man</i> was for ‘A Man’s a Man’. But
as the Revolution swept on with increasing bloodshed
to the execution of Louis XVI and as mobs in
various parts of Scotland, including Edinburgh itself,
celebrated King George’s birthday by burning
Henry Dundas in effigy, the authorities became
panicky. Scotland felt the heaviest force of their
fright. Long latent memories of the ’45 revived at
Whitehall, and to the dread of Scotland as a focal
point for rebellion was added the practical detail
that repressive measures could be better organized
there than in England. England had a few constituencies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
like London and Westminster, in which
enough people were enfranchised to give a really
popular vote, and a few members of Parliament
whom neither fear nor bribes could silence. Scotland
had neither. Hence the counter-revolutionary
reign of terror struck first and hardest at Scotland.</p>

<p>Early in 1793 several leaders of the Friends of the
People, a society organized to agitate for parliamentary
reform, were arrested on charges of treason.
Lord Daer was a member of the society, too, but
the authorities, doubtless afraid that not even a
packed jury could be trusted to convict the son of a
popular earl, made no move to seize him. They
contented themselves with lesser, but still conspicuous,
victims, and before the series of trials—conducted
with such disregard of justice as in Henry
Cockburn’s opinion had not been seen in Britain
since Jeffreys’s Bloody Assizes—was over Thomas
Muir, Thomas Palmer, and several other reform
leaders had been condemned to long terms of penal
transportation. All opposition was crushed in Scotland
for a generation. Henry Erskine, the one man
who dared to raise his voice in defence of justice and
common sense, paid for his temerity by being voted
out of his office as Dean of the Faculty of Advocates.
One of the last of Burns’s satirical ballads
commemorates the event, in which a young man
just admitted to the bar, Walter Scott by name,
voted with the majority to punish Erskine for having
the courage of his convictions.</p>

<p>Such was the background against which Burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
undertook to display himself as a Friend of the
People. He never, so far as can be learned, actually
joined any of the reforming organizations, but it
was not in Burns’s nature to conceal his opinions.
From the time when he appeared in Edinburgh
drawing-rooms wearing a waistcoat of Foxite blue
and buff, and inscribed on a window-pane at Stirling
verses about the successors to the Stuarts being
‘an idiot race, to honor lost’, he was marked as a
character who would bear watching. The wonder is
not so much that he came near to losing his job in
the Excise as that he ever succeeded in getting it.
If William Corbet and Graham of Fintry had not
been the generous and friendly souls they were, the
poet’s service career would have ended in 1793, and
he might even have shared the fate of Muir and
Palmer.</p>

<p>To note some of Burns’s words and deeds during
1791 and 1792, and realize that for every reckless
phrase that reached paper there were doubtless a
score uttered over the punchbowl, is to marvel at
the poet’s escape. His phrase about the House of
Hanover, already quoted, was written in the privacy
of Robert Riddell’s library, but it is hard to
believe that he did not say equally sharp things in
more public places. His most intimate friends in
Dumfries were avowed sympathizers with the Revolution.
Dr. James Maxwell had witnessed the execution
of the king, cherished the handkerchief he
had dipped in the royal blood, and was well enough
known to the authorities to have his revolutionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
connexions violently denounced by Burke on the
floor of the House of Commons. John Lewars was
tainted with ‘D-m-cratic heresy’; Syme, after enrolling,
like Burns, in the Dumfries Volunteers, became
heartily disgusted with the whole wretched
business; Maria Riddell was a parlour revolutionist
who on her visits to London associated ‘with a very
pleasant set of Sans-culottes’. Throughout 1792
Burns had let slip few opportunities of proclaiming
his own sympathies. In the spring he bought the
<i>Rosamond’s</i> carronades and dispatched them as a
present to the French Convention; in the autumn,
when Maria Riddell asked him to suggest a programme
for a benefit night in Dumfries theatre,
he chose from the repertory of the local company
Mrs. Centlivre’s <i>The Wonder: A Woman Keeps a Secret</i>
because it contained some platitudinous lines about
British liberty which could be given political significance
by well-timed applause. Either on this occasion
or another the crowd carried the matter further
than Burns had anticipated.</p>

<p>When ‘God Save the King’ was called for, a group
in the pit which included some of Burns’s friends
shouted for ‘Ça Ira’ instead. The ensuing clamour
came to the verge of a free-for-all fight. In his defence
Burns avowed that he never opened his lips
‘to hiss, or huzza, that, or any other Political tune
whatever’ because he looked on himself ‘as far too
obscure a man to have any weight in quelling a
Riot; at the same time as a character of higher respectability,
than to yell in the howlings of a rabble.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
In other words, by sitting still and not applauding
the national anthem he made himself just as conspicuous
as if he had joined in the call for ‘Ça Ira’.
He was anything but the obscure individual he
claimed to be, and it was apparently his public conduct
on this occasion that led to his being reported
to his superiors as a disaffected person.</p>

<p>Seemingly the idea that his opinions might get
him into trouble had never occurred to Burns. The
threat of an official investigation threw him into a
humiliating panic, and must also have alarmed his
friends in the higher ranks of the Excise. It is difficult
otherwise to account for Supervisor Corbet’s
coming in person to Dumfries to look into the
charges. An accusation brought against a minor
officer in the service was scarcely in ordinary routine
a serious enough affair to call in one of the highest
officials; the inference is that Corbet was rightly
fearful of the results if Burns were investigated by an
unfriendly agent. Accordingly the Supervisor examined
the poet across a dinner-table in company with
Findlater and Syme, and in that mellow atmosphere
found no ground for the charges ‘save some witty
sayings’. But even so, Corbet, in the name of the
Board, had to admonish Burns—so the poet reported
to Erskine of Mar—‘that <i>my</i> business was to
<i>act</i>, not to think; &amp; that whatever might be Men or
Measures, it was for me to be silent and obedient.’</p>

<p>The hair-splitting particularity of Burns’s defence
of his conduct is in itself proof of the real basis of the
charges against him. He revered the King, he declared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
in his public capacity as ‘the sacred Keystone
of our Royal Arch Constitution’, but George’s
‘private worth, it is altogether impossible that such a
man as I can appreciate.’ (On the report of the
King’s first admitted insanity in 1788 he had said,
‘I am not sure whether he is not a gainer, by how
much a Madman is a more respectable character
than a Fool.’) He had joined no party for revolution
or reform; his contributions to the radical <i>Edinburgh
Gazetteer</i> had been only a couple of non-political
verses. But he did not mention that in subscribing
to the <i>Gazetteer</i> he had urged its editor, William
Johnston, to ‘lay bare, with undaunted heart &amp;
steady hand, that horrid mass of corruption called
Politics &amp; State-Craft!’ and to ‘dare to draw in their
native colours these “Calm, thinking Villains whom
no faith can fix”—whatever be the Shibboleth of
their pretended Party.’ Oddly enough, the <i>Rosamond’s</i>
carronades had not been brought up against
him. Hence he naturally did not mention them, but
he took occasion to avow that though he had been
an enthusiastic votary of France at the beginning,
he had changed his sentiments since the Revolution
had embarked on a career of bloodshed and military
aggression.</p>

<p>Here Burns was making a Galileo recantation.
On the same day on which he thus denied to Robert
Graham that he any longer supported the Revolution
he was using French in a letter to Mrs. Dunlop
and adding that he hoped it was correct, for ‘much
would it go against my soul, to mar anything belonging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
to that gallant people: though my real sentiments
of them shall be confined alone to my letters
to you.’ Despite her repeated warnings to drop the
subject, he continued to talk about his devotion to
Liberty, his friendship with Dr. Maxwell, and his
approval of ‘the delivering over a perjured Blockhead
&amp; an unprincipled Prostitute to the hands of
the hangman’ until the offended lady broke off the
correspondence. Seething, as he had said of his feeling
in 1788, with the impotent ‘madness of an enraged
Scorpion shut up in a thumb-phial’, Burns
had to express himself to someone. He had lied
about his sentiments, and though the lie was to save
his family rather than himself, its taste was bitter in
his mouth. Nor was he helped by the realization
that all Scotland was equally cowed and that if he
had not made his recantation he would have shared
the fate of four other citizens of Dumfries who were
imprisoned for drinking seditious toasts. Once before
he had challenged authority in the shape of the temporal
power of the Kirk, and had come off not unscathed
but undefeated. Now he had challenged
much less openly the State, and had learned the difference
in strength between a vital institution and a
moribund one. The realization of defeat shook his
self-confidence as nothing else had ever done, and
helped to drive him to such unmanly conduct as
that which followed his quarrel with Maria Riddell.
He who had refused to sell his songs for money
had sold his independence for bread. That it was
his children’s bread and not his own might salve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
his conscience, but it could not heal his pride.</p>

<p>The Man of Feeling had bruised himself against
a harsher reality than anything Harley had found
in London or Bedlam; the idealist in politics had
learned the substance of which politicians are made.
Brimming with New Light theories about the Moral
Sense, convinced by primitivists like Rousseau that
‘mankind are by nature benevolent creatures’ whom
mere stress of hunger and poverty makes selfish,
Burns had come naked to battle against the forces
of alarmed conservatism and privilege. Like thousands
of others he had taken seriously the slogans of
‘Liberty’ and ‘the Rights of Man’, and had seen in
the French Revolution the signs that the world’s
great age was beginning anew. His disillusionment
went deeper than mere realization of his own unsafe
position as a government employee. He was
watching the ancient forces of selfishness and aggression
capture the movement from which he had
hoped so much. His enlistment in the Dumfries
Volunteers was not wholly from dread of further
jeopardizing his livelihood by holding aloof. He still
believed in the principles of the Revolution, but
that belief did not commit him to endorsement of
its practices, and so, like many another pacifist, he
found himself, still hating war, nevertheless engaged
in supporting it.</p>

<p>Though he dared no longer give direct utterance
to revolutionary sympathies, he could, and did, express
his detestation of war in a song like ‘Logan
Braes’, and couple the ideas of his generation with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
the patriotic tradition of medieval Scotland. The
low estate of contemporary Scottish liberty threw
into more glorious relief the traditions of Bannockburn
and the lost cause of the Stuarts. His patriotism
accepted without question the legend that ‘Hey
tutti taitie’ had been Bruce’s battle-march, as it
accepted the romantic interpretation of Mary
Queen of Scots. Burns might call himself an unprejudiced
inquirer and a sceptic, but his nature
had no kinship with the cool remorseless scepticism
of a man like David Hume. Hume’s was the keenest
Scottish mind of his century; Burns, at least in the
height of his rebellion against the Kirk, might have
been expected to find the philosopher congenial. But
Burns could endure destructive criticism only of
things he hated. Hume did not confine his scepticism
to religion, and when he brought his devastating
intellect to bear on the romantic traditions of
his country Burns turned away in anger. He might
endorse Hume’s demolition of the supernatural
sanctions of the church, but he was disquieted by
the application of the same scepticism to the belief
in immortality, and infuriated when it was turned
upon Queen Mary. Hume was mentally akin to
Voltaire and Samuel Butler; Burns to Rousseau and
Dickens.</p>

<p>In repudiating Hume’s treatment of Mary, Burns
was unconsciously illustrating the force of Johnson’s
ruthless dictum, which even the loyal Sir Walter
Scott could not wholly deny, that ‘a Scotchman
must be a very sturdy moralist who does not love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
Scotland better than truth: He will always love it
better than inquiry; and if falsehood flatters his
vanity, will not be very diligent to detect it.’ Few
men have lived more honest than Burns. He would
not willingly lie, nor endorse a lie; but if offered
choice between a romantic story which appealed to
his patriotism and an unromantic one which did
not, his choice was never in doubt. His own followers,
in their hostility to anything like dispassionate
investigation of the picturesque legends surrounding
him, continue to illustrate the same attitude. Nor,
indeed, have the Burnsians monopolized this aversion
to inquiry. It remained for an Irishman and an
American to set forth the true details of the life of
Allan Ramsay, and for another American to write
the only complete and scholarly study of Henry
Mackenzie and his times.</p>

<p>Many Scotsmen besides Burns shared his passionate
defence of Queen Mary; not so many shared
his general patriotism. Here Burns, very Scot of very
Scot, belonged to a generation which had passed,
though he prepared the way for one to come. He
had much in common with Claverhouse, Lochiel,
or Fletcher of Saltoun; nothing in common with
Bute, Wedderburn, or Henry Dundas. In so far as
the patriotism of Sir John Sinclair sought the improvement
of his country by collecting and tabulating
her resources, Burns was with him, but when
Sinclair tried to eradicate the national speech he
struck at something Burns held precious. True,
Burns was like his contemporaries in snatching at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
everything that seemed like proof that the Scots
could equal or surpass the English at their own
games. He applauded the <i>Mirror</i> and the <i>Lounger</i>
because they looked like successful rivals of the
<i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i>; he admired Thomson and
Beattie and Blair the more because even the English
had to admit that these men wrote well in the
southern tongue. But he deeply resented the willingness
of his countrymen to sink their national
identity in the Union.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Alas! have I often said to myself,’ he wrote to
Mrs. Dunlop in 1790, ‘what are all the boasted advantages
which my country reaps from the union, that can counterbalance
the annihilation of her Independance, and
even her very name! I often repeat that couplet of my
favorite poet, Goldsmith—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“——States of native liberty possest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tho’ very poor, may yet be very blest.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nothing can reconcile me to the common terms, “English
ambassador, English court,” &amp;c. And I am out of all
patience to see that equivocal character, Hastings, impeached
by “the Commons of England.” Tell me, my
friend, is this weak prejudice?’</p>
</div>

<p>Men like Boswell and Sinclair would have answered
without hesitation that it was. The Union
had admitted Scotland to as much share as she
could grasp of the wealth of the British Empire;
commerce and industry were increasing year by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
year; the poor relation was beginning to live like
the prosperous branch of the family. For such profits,
the change of name from ‘Scotland’ to ‘North
Britain’ seemed a small price. To those who shared
in the new prosperity, the suggestion of a nationalist
movement would have seemed rank folly or even
downright treason. So long as the prosperity continued,
indeed, the ‘practical men’ had the overwhelming
majority of their countrymen with them.
The emergence of Scottish nationalism as a political
force to be reckoned with had to await the collapse
of Scottish industry which followed the World War.
With the loss of material prosperity, the Scots have
begun to question the value of the system which
transfers to Westminster the control of their local
affairs. Scottish poverty and Scottish pride are
seemingly interdependent. Removal of the one will
make the nation more willing to swallow the other.</p>

<p>Even if Burns had shared the material prosperity
resulting from the Union, instead of helping, as
tenant of rack-rented land, to pay for it, his feelings
would have been the same. In every fibre of his
being he shared the spirit of those Scots who, in
contradiction of every proverbial association of
pawky caution with their race, have been among
the greatest soldiers, explorers, and idealists of
modern history. Montrose and Livingstone, Admiral
Duncan and Mungo Park, expressed in action
the national traits which he expressed in song. His
calling, consciously accepted, was that of national
poet; his other activities merely the ‘sweat, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
base machine might have its oil’. He refused payment
for his songs, because the task of supplying words to
national melodies was a patriotic service, embalming
and treasuring up these relics of his country’s
spirit to a life beyond life.</p>

<p>Without Burns’s share in the work of gathering
old Jacobite songs, for instance, and composing new
ones, it may be questioned if such a halo of romance
would have surrounded, in the next generation, the
Rebellions of 1715 and 1745; without that halo,
Sir Walter Scott would have been less readily attracted
to them; without Sir Walter, the romantic
vision of Scottish history would never have conquered
the world. No Scottish writer of the eighteenth
century, except Burns, passed on the torch of
national pride. Without him, the fact that Hume
and Boswell were Scotsmen, that Thomson was born
on Tweed instead of Thames, would mean no more
to the ordinary reader than does the fact that Swift
was born in Ireland or Wordsworth in Cumberland.
Without him, Ramsay and Fergusson would be forgotten
minor poets who wrote in a difficult and obsolete
dialect. He gathered together in his own work
all that was vital in the work of his predecessors, infused
it with the fire of his own personality, and sent
it out again to keep Scotland alive.</p>

<p>Burns came at the last moment when a national
poet could succeed in his task. A few decades later,
and the vernacular would have sunk too low for
preservation. Even as it was, he could only embalm
it and not renew it as poetic speech. Except for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
Lady Nairne’s, scarcely any vernacular poetry written
in Scotland since 1800 deserves higher ranking
than the <i>Barrack-Room Ballads</i>. As a poetic influence,
Burns’s work was weak. As a national influence, its
force is not yet spent. He revealed the richness and
colour of Scottish life, and in revealing it gave direction
and vitality to the long and noble line of novelists
which began with Sir Walter Scott and John Galt,
and continued through Stevenson to John Buchan
and the late Neil Munro. Through these men the
Scotland which was no longer, politically, a nation
became more enduring than anything which
depends on rulers and boundaries—a nation of the
mind and heart, a home of lost causes, of impossible
loyalties, of high romance and simple faith. It is not
Scott’s kings and ladies and nobles who keep his
books alive; it is people like Edie Ochiltree, Jeanie
Deans, Meg Dods, and Dandie Dinmont—in other
words, the characters who are part and parcel of the
world which Burns depicted and glorified. Steenie
Steenson, like Thrawn Janet and Tod Lapraik, carries
on the great tradition of Tam o’ Shanter. Without
Burns the Scottish novel as we know it would
never have been; without the Scottish novel, the
literature of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
would be as much the poorer as seventeenth-century
poetry would be without the Cavaliers.</p>

<p>In tracing the continuing tradition of sentiment
from Henry Mackenzie through Burns himself to
‘Ian Maclaren’ and Sir James Barrie, Professor
Thompson made perforce a grave omission. The difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
between the dynamic romanticism of England
at the beginning of the last century—the romanticism
of the young Wordsworth and of Shelley—and
the insipid prettiness of the same movement
in America at the same time, lies in the invigorating
power of the French Revolution. By giving a fighting
edge to romance, the Revolution raised it above
mere fancifulness and sentimentality. His patriotism
did the same thing for the influence of Burns. Without
it he might today be only a minor Man of Feeling.
Even as it is, he is neglected and misunderstood.
The strength, the humour, the fighting edge are
there, but few people care to find them.</p>

<p>He saved Scotland; himself he could not save.
Five years after his death a group of admirers in
Greenock organized a Burns Club, and Paisley and
Kilmarnock quickly followed suit. The fashion
spread through Scotland, and among Scotsmen in the
rest of the English-speaking world, bringing in its
train the erection of more, and worse, statues and
monuments than have been reared to the memory of
any other British individual with the possible exception
of Albert, Prince Consort. Soon the movement
acquired the characteristics of a minor religious cult,
complete with ritual meals and a thriving traffic in
relics, genuine or spurious, of its hero.</p>

<p>In itself this establishment as hero of a national
cult might be harmless. After all, if any writer was
to fill the role, Burns was the inevitable candidate,
for he alone of the great Scottish writers was truly
a man of the people. Not the existence of the cult,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
but the direction it took, is the tragedy of Burns. The
sentimentality which lies, like the soft core of an
over-ripe pear, at the heart of writers like ‘Ian Maclaren’,
Sir James Barrie, and A. A. Milne, is widespread
in Scotland. In the Burns cult this softness
yearns to the answering softness of ‘The Cotter’s
Saturday Night’, ‘To a Mouse’, and ‘To a Mountain
Daisy’, extols its hero as the Bard of Humanity and
Democracy, and rejoices in the bathos of Clarinda
and Highland Mary. Meanwhile the ribald magnificence
of ‘Holy Willie’ and ‘The Jolly Beggars’ is neglected,
the homely realism of satires, epistles, and
dramatic monologues goes unread. Worst of all, the
splendid treasury of more than three hundred songs,
Burns’s most truly patriotic work, lies almost untouched
on the shelves. Radio and concert stage
alike ignore them. And choice of the few that are
known to the public at large runs true to the same
form as with the longer poems. Probably a hundred
people know ‘Sweet Afton’ for one who knows
‘M’Pherson’s Farewell’ or ‘Rantin’ Rovin’ Robin’.</p>

<p>The flattery of being a national hero would delight
Burns. If his followers were only mealy-mouthed
where he was outspoken, they would
merely amuse him. He would not mind if they slobbered
over his sins, for the unco guid were old acquaintance
of his. But at the thought of his worshippers
exalting his weakest work and ignoring his best,
his very soul would scunner. The real Burns was
not the dropper of tears over ploughed-under weeds
but the man who brought in the neighbours for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
kirn-night and kissed the lasses after every dance;
the man who sat by farmers’ ingles and on ale-house
benches listening to the racy earthy talk of his people
and storing his mind with folk sayings and old songs.
He was not ashamed of being a Scottish peasant,
the heir of all the picturesque and frequently bawdy
tradition of Scots folk literature. Neither was the
man who wrote, ‘But yet the light that led astray
Was light from Heaven’, ashamed of his human nature.
But his worshippers are ashamed of the best
part of his nature and his work. And nobody else
reads him at all.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
